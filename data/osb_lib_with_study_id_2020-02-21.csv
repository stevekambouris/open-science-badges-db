Past research has suggested that cognitive reappraisals are associated with changes in memory of emotions. We investigated whether these findings would generalize to an important emotion (love), target (mothers), and time (childhood). In samples of adults, we manipulated current appraisals of mothers to examine the effect on memory of love felt in childhood toward mothers. In Experiment 1, we found significant differences between appraisal conditions on memory of love—effects that persisted for 4 weeks. In Experiment 2, the effect of reappraisal on memory of love replicated with a pretest–posttest experiment. Pretest current feelings of love were biased when recalled after the experiment. Reevaluating parents, in therapy or elsewhere, may result in memory distortion of important aspects of autobiographical memory.",2019-09-01,2020-01-30T05:29:22Z,2020-01-30T05:29:35Z,2020-01-30T05:29:22Z,1125-1143,NA,5,7,NA,Clinical Psychological Science,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S9S72PWS\Patihis et al. - 2019 - Changing Current Appraisals of Mothers Leads to Ch.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,emotion; memory; open data; open materials; autobiographical memory; appraisal; love; mother,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000001

Using a multimethod approach, we found evidence of a significant positive within-state association between income inequality and Whites’ explicit racial bias. However, the effect was small, with income inequality accounting for 0.4% to 0.7% of within-state variation in racial bias, and was also contingent on model specification, with results dependent on the measure of income inequality used.

We investigate whether expressions of negative emotions, in particular regret, following economic decisions can shape intergroup trust. In each of three studies participants were members of a group playing a two-round trust game with another group. In the first round, they observed an outgroup member who acted fairly or unfairly towards the ingroup and then expressed positive (i.e., happiness) or negative (i.e., regret, unhappiness) emotions about this behavior. In the second round, participants played with another outgroup member. Emotions displayed by the outgroup representative following unfair behavior in round 1 influenced participants' allocations in round 2, which were higher following regret and unhappiness than following positive emotions. Thus, emotions expressed by one outgroup member affected interactions with other members who had not communicated emotions. Findings of Study 3 revealed that these effects were driven by regret increasing intergroup trust, rather than by happiness decreasing it. Moreover, participants' allocations were predicted by their perceptions of the extent to which the outgroup representative wished to change her behavior.

Through a half?block quasi?experimental design, a large sample of young adults (i.e. responders; n?=?335) viewed videos of opposite?sex persons (i.e. targets) talking about themselves, and responders rated the targets' traits and their romantic interest in the target. We tested whether similarity, dissimilarity or overall trait levels on mate value, physical attractiveness, life history strategy and the Big Five personality factors predicted romantic interest at zero acquaintance and whether sex acted as a moderator. We tested the responders' individual perception of the targets' traits, in addition to the targets' own self?reported trait levels and a consensus rating of the targets made by the responders. We used polynomial regression with response surface analysis within multilevel modelling to test support for each of the hypotheses. Results suggest a large sex difference in trait perception; when women rated men, they agreed in their perception more often than when men rated women. However, as a predictor of romantic interest, there were no sex differences. Only the responders' perception of the targets' physical attractiveness predicted romantic interest; specifically, responders' who rated the targets' physical attractiveness as higher than themselves reported more romantic interest.

VRK2 has long been known for its relationship with neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia. However, the role of VRK2 and the substrates associated with it are unknown. Dysbindin is known as one of the strong risk factors for schizophrenia. The expression of dysbindin is indeed significantly reduced in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, dysbindin is involved in neurite outgrowth and regulation of NMDA receptor signaling. Here, we first identified dysbindin as a novel interacting protein of VRK2 through immunoprecipitation. We hypothesized that dysbindin is phosphorylated by VRK2 and further that this phosphorylation plays an important role in the function of dysbindin. We show that VRK2 phosphorylates Ser 297 and Ser 299 of dysbindin using in vitro kinase assay. In addition, we found that VRK2-mediated phosphorylation of dysbindin enhanced ubiquitination of dysbindin and consequently resulted in the decrease in its protein stability through western blotting. Over-expression of VRK2 in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells reduced neurite outgrowth induced by retinoic acid. Furthermore, a phosphomimetic mutant of dysbindin alleviated neurite outgrowth and affected surface expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate 2A, a subunit of NMDA receptor in mouse hippocampal neurons. Together, our work reveals the regulation of dysbindin by VRK2, providing the association of these two proteins, which are commonly implicated in schizophrenia.

We replicate these findings with a group of native speakers and extend the paradigm to second language (L2) users.

However, because VRAC opening requires cytosolic ATP, it is not clear if and how its activity is sustained in the metabolically compromised CNS. In the present study, we used cultured astrocytes – the cell type which shows prominent swelling in stroke – to model how metabolic stress and changes in gene expression may impact VRAC function in the ischemic and post-ischemic brain. The metabolic state of primary rat astrocytes was modified with chemical inhibitors and examined using luciferin–luciferase ATP assays and a Seahorse analyzer. Swelling-activated glutamate release was quantified with the radiotracer D-[3H]aspartate. The specific contribution of VRAC to swelling-activated glutamate efflux was validated by RNAi knockdown of the essential subunit, leucine-rich repeat-containing 8A (LRRC8A); expression levels of VRAC components were measured with qRT-PCR. Using this methodology, we found that complete metabolic inhibition with the glycolysis blocker 2-deoxy-D-glucose and the mitochondrial poison sodium cyanide reduced astrocytic ATP levels by > 90% and abolished glutamate release from swollen cells (via VRAC). When only mitochondrial respiration was inhibited by cyanide or rotenone, the intracellular ATP levels and VRAC activity were largely preserved. Bypassing glycolysis by providing the mitochondrial substrates pyruvate and/or glutamine led to partial recovery of ATP levels and VRAC activity. Unexpectedly, the metabolic block of VRAC was overridden when ATP-depleted cells were exposed to extreme cell swelling (≥ 50% reduction in medium osmolarity). Twenty-four hour anoxic adaptation caused a moderate reduction in the expression levels of the VRAC component LRRC8A, but no significant changes in VRAC activity. Overall, our findings suggest that (i) astrocytic VRAC activity and metabolism can be sustained by low levels of glucose and (ii) the inhibitory influence of diminishing ATP levels and the stimulatory effect of cellular swelling are the two major factors that govern VRAC activity in the ischemic brain.",2019,2020-02-06T02:40:54Z,2020-02-06T02:41:17Z,2020-02-06T02:40:54Z,255-272,NA,2,151,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9UFBBHYK\Wilson et al. - 2019 - Metabolic constraints of swelling-activated glutam.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SHJAG3NR\jnc.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,cerebral ischemia; LRRC8; metabolic inhibition; stroke; volume-regulated anion channel,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000016

We consider four contrasting predictions based on the existing psychological literature. The first two are derived from the need-threat literature: Following social rejection individuals may withdraw from cooperative interaction in general (aggression hypothesis), or cooperate more in general (reconnection hypothesis). Alternatively, performance of the excluded individuals in cooperative tasks may worsen reflecting reduced ability to deliberate (cognitive depletion hypothesis). Finally, excluded individuals may cooperate less with those who rejected them (revenge hypothesis). We tested these hypotheses in three incentivized experiments. In each, we first varied whether participants were excluded or included in a virtual ball-passing game. In the second part, participants entered a two-player investment game, in which their earnings were partly dependent on the cooperativeness of their partner. We varied how cooperative the co-player was, and measured whether our participants were willing to cooperate or not. All participants entered the game twice, once with an unknown player, and once with a person who they previously encountered during the ball-passing task. Our findings were consistent with the revenge hypothesis – excluded participants were less cooperative when they were paired with the individual who previously excluded them. Interactions with unknown players were unaffected – excluded and included participants were equally cooperative. We propose a straightforward explanation of our findings: People do not like to cooperate with those who previously rejected them, but the experience of rejection does not have broad implications for people's overall willingness to cooperate.",2019-05-01,2020-02-04T03:31:59Z,2020-02-04T03:32:28Z,2020-02-04T03:31:59Z,35-46,NA,NA,82,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\22MTDQ9Y\Walasek et al. - 2019 - Adaptive cooperation in the face of social exclusi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PD9SMN58\S0022103118301240.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Aggression; Trust; Cooperation; Group dynamics; Ostracism; Psychological need; Social exclusion,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000017

Positive simulation resulted in a liberal response bias for positive information and a conservative bias for negative information. Events preceded by positive simulation were considered more favorably in retrospect. In contrast, negative simulation had no impact on subsequent memory.

In addition to enhancing the theoretical model of employee motivation to accept organizational leadership responsibilities, the results have practical significance for organizations concerned with attracting and developing millennial organizational leaders.",2019-03-04,2020-02-04T06:04:08Z,2020-02-04T06:04:26Z,2020-02-04T06:04:08Z,138-152,NA,2,159,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,NA,PMID: 31002295,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I8A5GJ6T\Porter et al. - 2019 - An exploratory study of gender and motivation to l.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VLJ5V5HY\00224545.2019.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Gender; leadership; millennials; motivation to lead,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000022

In humans, correlational studies have linked testosterone with aggression and disorders associated with poor impulse control, but the neuropsychological processes at work are poorly understood. Building on a dual-process framework, we propose a mechanism underlying testosterone’s behavioral effects in humans: reduction in cognitive reflection. In the largest study of behavioral effects of testosterone administration to date, 243 men received either testosterone or placebo and took the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), which estimates the capacity to override incorrect intuitive judgments with deliberate correct responses. Testosterone administration reduced CRT scores. The effect remained after we controlled for age, mood, math skills, whether participants believed they had received the placebo or testosterone, and the effects of 14 additional hormones, and it held for each of the CRT questions in isolation.

Across a wide variety of contexts, we show that when summarizing evidence, people exhibit a binary bias: a tendency to impose categorical distinctions on continuous data. Evidence is compressed into discrete bins, and the difference between categories forms the summary judgment. The binary bias distorts belief formation—such that when people aggregate conflicting scientific reports, they attend to valence and inaccurately weight the extremity of the evidence. The same effect occurs when people interpret popular forms of data visualization, and it cannot be explained by other statistical features of the stimuli. This effect is not confined to explicit statistical estimates; it also influences how people use data to make health, financial, and public-policy decisions.

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate evidence of lactate as a physiological effector within the normal cerebral microcirculation in reports ranging from in vitro experiments to in vivo studies in animals and humans. Following pre-registration of a review protocol, we systematically searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for literature covering themes of ?lactate?, ?the brain?, and ?microcirculation?. Abstracts were screened, and data extracted independently by two individuals. We excluded studies evaluating lactate in disease models. Twenty-eight papers were identified, 18 of which were in vivo animal experiments (65%), four on human studies (14%), and six on in vitro or ex vivo experiments (21%). Approximately half of the papers identified lactate as an augmenter of the hyperemic response to functional activation by a visual stimulus or as an instigator of hyperemia in a dose-dependent manner, without external stimulation. The mechanisms are likely to be coupled to NAD+/NADH redox state influencing the production of nitric oxide. Unfortunately, only 38% of these studies demonstrated any control for bias, which makes reliable generalizations of the conclusions insecure. This systematic review identifies that lactate may act as a dose-dependent regulator of cerebral microcirculation by augmenting the hyperemic response to functional activation below 5 mmol/kg, and by initiating a hyperemic response above 5 mmol/kg.

We briefly review the various terms and uses of ILMs in various fields of psychology and present five main strategies that can help researchers infer causality in ILM studies. We discuss the use of temporal precedence to establish causality, through both lagged analyses and natural experiments; the use of external measures and peer reports to go beyond self-report data; delving deeper into repeated measures to derive new indices; the use of contextual factors occurring during the measurement period; and combining experimental methods and ILMs. These strategies are illustrated by examples from existing research and by new empirical findings from two dyadic daily diary studies (N = 80 and N = 108 couples) and an experience sampling method study of personality states (N = 52). We conclude by offering a short checklist for designing ILM studies with causality in mind and look at the applicability of these strategies in the intersection of personality psychology and other psychological research domains.

In Study 1, 128 undergraduates viewed beer cues while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Results showed that beer cues paired with in-group backgrounds (logos for students’ universities) evoked an enhanced P3 ERP component, a neural index of incentive salience.

We test whether target age, gender, and political ideological extremity account for the effect, and find that target ideological extremity independently predicts greater perceived fixedness.

High-functioning adults with ASD showed intact but reduced IAT effects relative to healthy control participants. We observed no selective attenuation of implicit social (vs. nonsocial) biases in our ASD population. To extend these results, we supplemented our healthy control data with data collected from a large online sample from the general population and explored correlations between autistic traits and IAT effects.

Four experiments demonstrated that individuals evaluate consensus only superficially: Participants were equally confident in conclusions drawn from a true consensus (derived from independent primary sources) and a false consensus (derived from only one primary source).

Because many illusions rely on integrating sensory input with prior information such as spatial context, individuals with ASD may therefore be less susceptible to visual illusions than typically developing (TD) individuals. Yet empirical evidence on the matter is rather divergent, varying depending on the type of illusion, study procedure, and population. Visual illusions lead to neural activity alterations in the visual system. In the so-called Kanizsa illusion, these are likely caused by top-down feedback to V1. Here we tested the hypothesis that a reduced susceptibility to illusions in ASD would manifest as diminished modulation of V1 activity by illusions, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We presented 22 adolescents with ASD and 22 age-, gender-, and intelligence-matched TD controls with displays that consisted of three circular inducers. These either formed an illusory triangle (Kanizsa illusion) or not. We identified regions in primary visual cortex (V1) that corresponded to (the visual field locations of) the illusory triangle and its inducers, and recorded their visual response. Previous research in healthy volunteers has shown a specific pattern of up- and down-regulation in regions of V1 that process the shape and inducers, respectively. Here, we replicated this pattern of up- and downregulation in V1, in both the TD and ASD groups, with no differences between groups. This suggests that illusory shape processing in primary visual cortex is equally present in ASD, suggesting unimpaired processing of spatial context.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:17:12Z,2020-01-30T07:17:33Z,2020-01-30T07:17:12Z,247-256,NA,NA,117,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\R4VWTVN4\Utzerath et al. - 2019 - No evidence for altered up- and downregulation of .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EP5B9TS4\S0010945219301236.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,fMRI; Autism spectrum disorder; Hypoprior; Illusions; Perception,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000037

Using potentially problematic methods to examine the factor structure of the SCS (higher-order confirmatory factor analysis), they suggest a total self-compassion score should not be used and negative items should be dropped. In Study 1, we present a reanalysis of their data using what we argue are more theoretically appropriate methods (bifactor exploratory structural equation modelling) that support use of a global self-compassion factor (explaining 94% of item variance) over separate factors representing compassionate and reduced uncompassionate self-responding. While self-compassion evidenced a large correlation with neuroticism and depression and a small correlation with anxiety, it explained meaningful incremental validity in life satisfaction compared with neuroticism, depression, and anxiety. Findings were replicated in Study 2, which examined emotion regulation. Study 3 established the incremental validity of negative items with multiple well-being outcomes.

Rather than use unsupervised methods to recover a latent dimension that best explains patterns in giving, donation patterns are instead mapped onto a target measure of legislative voting behavior. Supervised models significantly outperform alternative measures of ideology in predicting legislative voting behavior. Fundraising prior to entering office provides a highly informative signal about future voting behavior. Impressively, forecasts based on fundraising as a nonincumbent predict future voting behavior as accurately as in-sample forecasts based on votes cast during a legislator's first 2 years in Congress. The combined results demonstrate campaign contributions are powerful predictors of roll-call voting behavior and resolve an ongoing debate as to whether contribution data successfully distinguish between members of the same party.",2018-10-01,2019-03-20T11:40:46Z,2019-03-20T11:41:58Z,2019-03-20T11:40:46Z,830-848,NA,4,62,NA,American Journal of Political Science,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6RAH6QUD\Bonica - 2018 - Inferring Roll-Call Scores from Campaign Contribut.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FLSGC7PS\ajps.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000039

Specifically, we hypothesized that understanding another person’s thoughts and feelings (empathic accuracy) would foster responsive behavior only when paired with benevolent motivation (empathic concern). To test this idea, we asked couples (N = 91) to discuss a personal or relationship stressor; we then assessed empathic accuracy, empathic concern, and responsive behavior. As predicted, when listeners’ empathic concern was high, empathic accuracy facilitated responsiveness; but when empathic concern was low, empathic accuracy was unhelpful (and possibly harmful) for responsiveness.

In two experiments (N=814; N=809), organizational structure (hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical) and membership (baseline vs. minority) were manipulated. Stronger preference for maintaining inequality was associated with increased desire to limit a minority organization's access to power, specifically when that organization was hierarchical.

Our sample comprised 16,713 participants from the Central Europe and 1,090 participants from the Baltic Sea region. Participants rated national stereotypes of their own country using the National Character Survey (NCS) and their personality traits using either the Revised NEO Personality Inventory or the NCS. We examined the effects of different (i) methods for rating of real people (Revised NEO Personality Inventory vs. NCS) and national stereotypes (NCS); (ii) norms for converting raw scores into T-scores (Russian vs. international norms); and (iii) correlation techniques (intraclass correlations vs. Pearson correlations vs. rank-order correlations) on the resulting agreement between the ratings of national stereotypes and real people. We showed that the accuracy of national stereotypes depended on the employed methodology. The accuracy was the highest when ratings of real people and national stereotypes were made using the same method and when rank order correlations were used to estimate the agreement between national stereotypes and personality profiles of real people. We propose a new statistical procedure for determining national stereotype accuracy that overcomes limitations of past studies. We provide methodological recommendations applicable to a wider range of cross national stereotype accuracy studies.

Syntax (the rules for combining words into sentences) has been robustly shown to be a cue to word meaning. But how can infants access syntactic information when they are still acquiring the meanings of words? We investigated the contribution of two cues that may help infants break into the syntax and give a boost to their lexical acquisition: phrasal prosody (speech melody) and function words, both of which are accessible early in life and correlate with syntactic structure in the world’s languages. We show that 18-month-old infants use prosody and function words to recover sentences’ syntactic structure, which in turn constrains the possible meanings of novel words: Participants (N = 48 in each of two experiments) interpreted a novel word as referring to either an object or an action, given its position within the prosodic-syntactic structure of sentences.",2019-03,2019-04-06T18:59:25Z,2019-04-06T18:59:43Z,2019-04-06T18:59:25Z,319-332,NA,3,30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8QW97QR2\de Carvalho e.a. - 2019 - Prosody and Function Words Cue the Acquisition of .pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,OSBadgePreregisteredPlus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a000045

Most researchers, however, have focused on unidimensional rather than multidimensional conceptualizations of self-esteem. The paucity of empirical research is surprising given conflicting theoretical perspectives on the stability of self-esteem. The goal of the present study was to thoroughly disentangle different conceptualizations of self-esteem and test opposing classical theories on (i) the stability and (ii) the direction of mutual influence of these different forms of self-esteem. We analysed two-year longitudinal data from participants (N = 644 at T1, N = 241 at T2) with an average age of 47.0 years (SD = 12.4). Analyses using a latent variable approach revealed that the domains of self-esteem were relatively stable in terms of rank order and mean levels. In fact, the size of the stability coefficients was comparable to that of other trait measures that have been reported in the literature and paralleled the stability observed for global self-esteem. Results did not provide support for either top-down or bottom-up effects between domain-specific and global self-esteem. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications regarding the stability and development of self-esteem in adulthood and advance the understanding of self-esteem in personality theory. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2018,2019-03-20T17:30:28Z,2019-03-20T17:31:04Z,2019-03-20T17:30:28Z,353-370,NA,4,32,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MGSXBJSS\Rentzsch en Schröder‐Abé - 2018 - Stability and Change in Domain-specific Self-estee.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DN7LM4F7\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,self-esteem; adulthood; domain specific; multidimensional; stability,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000047

However, according to the Evaluative Model of Normative Appeals (EMNA), between these two processes we carry out an evaluation (normative appraisal) that strongly influences the decision that is ultimately made. Specifically, this normative appraisal, which is done in accordance with the dimensions of formality and protection, transforms the appeal into a particular normative representation (i.e., custom, coercive law, prescription, or legitimate law) that, in turn, influences the willingness toward compliance or violation.

We here present the results of a systematic review to investigate how the standards in this field changed over the 10-year period during which the guidelines were first published (2007) and updated (2010). Methods We searched for papers reporting ALS research on SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1) mice published between 2005 and 2015 on the ISI Web of Science database, resulting in a sample of 569 papers to review, after triage. Two scores—one for methodological quality, one for regulatory compliance—were built from weighted sums of separate sets of items, and subjected to multivariable regression analysis, to assess how these related to publication year, type of study, country of origin and journal. Results Reporting standards improved over time. Of papers published after the first ALS guidelines were made public, fewer than 9% referred specifically to these. Of key research parameters, only three (genetic background, number of transgenes and group size) were reported in >50% of the papers. Information on housing conditions, randomisation and blinding was absent in over two-thirds of the papers. Group size was among the best reported parameters, but the majority reported using fewer than the recommended sample size and only two studies clearly justified group size. Conclusions General methodological standards improved gradually over a period of 8–10 years, but remained generally comparable with related fields with no specific guidelines, except with regard to severity. Only 11% of ALS studies were classified in the highest severity level (animals allowed to reach death or moribund stages), substantially below the proportion in studies of comparable neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s. The existence of field-specific guidelines, although a welcome indication of concern, seems insufficient to ensure adherence to high methodological standards. Other mechanisms may be required to improve methodological and welfare standards.",2019-08-01,2020-01-28T06:46:37Z,2020-01-28T06:47:03Z,2020-01-28T06:46:37Z,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,"Methodological standards, quality of reporting and regulatory compliance in animal research on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, the origins of these judgments remain unclear. Using the legal system as an example domain in which people receive punishment, the current work employed two complementary approaches to examine how punishment-related concepts emerge. Study 1 tested both 6- to 8-year-olds and adults to ascertain which components of “end-state” punishment concepts emerge early in development and remain stable over time, and which components of punishment concepts change with age. Children, like adults, agreed with and spontaneously generated behavioral explanations for incarceration. However, children were more likely than adults to attribute incarceration to internal characteristics. Neither children nor adults reported that incarceration stems from societal-level factors such as poverty. Study 2 built on the results of Study 1 by probing the extent to which early punishment-related concepts in the legal domain emerge from a specific form of social experience—namely, parental incarceration. Children of incarcerated parents, like children whose parents were not incarcerated, were more likely to reference internal and behavioral factors than societal factors when discussing why people come into contact with the justice system. Taken together, these studies clarify how punishment-related concepts arise and therefore contribute to theories of moral psychology, social cognitive development, and criminal justice.",2020-03-01,2020-02-06T01:27:18Z,2020-02-10T11:51:46Z,2020-02-06T01:27:18Z,103913,NA,NA,87,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MK5SA8WC\Dunlea and Heiphetz - 2020 - Children's and adults' understanding of punishment.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IL79MVRS\S0022103119304494.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Morality; Punishment; Social cognitive development; Explanation; Incarceration,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000052

Four main experiments and six supplemental studies (total N = 3684) demonstrate that people prefer to direct persuasion efforts toward individuals who seem poised to shift their attitudes qualitatively (e.g., from negative to positive) rather than non-qualitatively (e.g., from positive to more positive). This preference stems from the fact that qualitative attitude change is perceived as greater in magnitude and expected to have a larger impact on behavior. These findings provide initial insight into the factors that drive persuasion target selection, and are inconsistent with what past persuasion research, conventional marketing wisdom, and our empirical evidence suggests persuaders should do.

In this study, we systematically investigated the correspondence between auditory number words and visual Arabic digits in adults. Auditory number words and visual Arabic digits were presented concurrently or sequentially and participants had to indicate whether they described the same quantity. We manipulated the stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) between the two stimuli (Experiment 1: −500 ms to +500 ms; Experiment 2: −200 ms to +200 ms). In both experiments, we found a significant cross-modal distance effect. This effect was strongest for simultaneous stimulus presentation and decreased with increasing SOAs. Numerical distance emerged as the most consistent significant predictor overall, in particular for simultaneous presentation. However, physical similarity between the stimuli was often a significant predictor of response times in addition to numerical distance, and at longer SOAs, physical similarity between the stimuli was the only significant predictor. This shows that SOA modulates the extent to which participants access quantity representations. Our results thus support the idea that a semantic quantity representation of auditory and visual numerical symbols is activated when participants perform a concurrent matching task, while at longer SOAs participants are more likely to rely on physical similarity between the stimuli. We also investigated whether individual differences in the efficiency of the cross-modal processing were related to differences in mathematical performance. Our results are inconclusive about whether the efficiency of cross-format numerical correspondence is related to mathematical competence in adults.",2019-11-01,2020-02-05T06:22:43Z,2020-02-05T06:22:54Z,2020-02-05T06:22:43Z,2632-2646,NA,11,72,NA,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,Arabic digits and spoken number words,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ECMPQNCF\Lin and Göbel - 2019 - Arabic digits and spoken number words Timing modu.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,cross-format correspondence; Numerical distance effect; physical similarity; same–different task; spoken number words; stimulus onset asynchrony,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000054

Strikingly, however, these patients can nevertheless show a preservation in their ability to recognize real-world objects –a phenomenon known as the ‘real-object advantage’ (ROA) in agnosia. To uncover the mechanisms that support the ROA, patients were asked to identify objects whose size was congruent or incongruent with typical real-world size, presented in different display formats (real objects, 2-D and 3-D images). While recognition of images was extremely poor, real object recognition was surprisingly preserved, but only when physical size matched real-world size.

Individual training consisted of two mediated learning experiences conducted in the L1 targeting eight vocabulary items using narrative?based activities. Four of eight target words were cognates between Spanish and English. Pre? and posttesting measured definition quality in the L1 and L2.

Whereas the Honesty–Humility dimension from the HEXACO model of personality has been identified as a consistent predictor of cooperation, the underlying motivational mechanisms of this association have remained unclear—especially given the confound between the temptation to exploit others and the fear of being exploited as motivational drivers of defection in social dilemmas. In a reanalysis and a new experiment, we tease apart these mechanisms by manipulating the rank order of pay-offs in a symmetric two-person game paradigm, essentially implementing the classic prisoner's dilemma, stag hunt, and chicken games. Results revealed that Honesty–Humility predicted cooperation specifically in the games in which temptation was a potential motivator of defection, whereas it did not account for cooperation in those games in which only fear implied defection. Our findings thereby shed light on the underlying motivational mechanisms of the Honesty–Humility–cooperation link and, more generally, demonstrate how economic games can be used to disentangle such mechanisms.

Our hypothesis was clearly supported: When vision overstated the amount of rotation, pain occurred at 7% less rotation than under conditions of accurate visual feedback, and when vision understated rotation, pain occurred at 6% greater rotation than under conditions of accurate visual feedback.

This is an important finding for the OFDI literature from emerging markets, since previous studies have researched this relationship from the OFDI perspective of developed countries. However, we also find a weak indication of a potential U-shaped relationship between the strength of IP institutions and Chinese OFDI. To better understand this relationship, we interact a European country’s membership in the Former Eastern Bloc (FEB) with the strength of IP institutions and find a negative moderating effect. We therefore find that when investing in FEB countries, Chinese firms are attracted to weaker levels of IP institutional strength.

These lines of evidence suggest critical roles of ER stress at the early stage of neurodegeneration, but the relevant mechanism is rarely exploited. In this study, we report that treatment with sublethal level of ER stressors, tunicamycin or brefeldin A, in primary rat neuronal cultures, significantly reduced dendrite arbor. Under the same treatment, either stressor reduced store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and cytosolic calcium, [Ca2+]i, which were associated with autophagic degradation of stromal interaction molecule 2 (STIM2). Knockdown of ATG7 or activating transcription factor 4 completely reversed the reduction of STIM2 and significantly reversed the inhibition of SOCE under ER stress. Overexpression of STIM2 in neurons significantly prevented the ER stress-induced disruption of dendrite arbor. Altogether, our data reveal an unprecedented mechanism by which ER stress induces dendrite degeneration, that is, ER stress induces autophagic degradation of STIM2, leading to ensued SOCE inhibition and reduced [Ca2+]i, resulting in trimming effect on dendrites.",2019,2020-02-06T02:44:47Z,2020-02-06T02:45:27Z,2020-02-06T02:44:47Z,351-369,NA,3,151,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TLSYZIGN\Zhou et al. - 2019 - Autophagic degradation of stromal interaction mole.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PL9E6IH7\jnc.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Parkinson's disease; autophagy; Alzheimer's disease; unfolded protein response; dendrites; store-operated calcium entry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000065

We expected this effect to emerge when people are perceived as relatively mindless, such as when they disagree with the evaluator’s own beliefs. Three experiments involving polarizing attitudinal issues and political opinions supported these hypotheses. A fourth experiment identified paralinguistic cues in the human voice that convey basic mental capacities.

Through what psychological processes do dynamic norms operate? We theorized that, when others change, it can lead observers to infer that whatever factors had loomed large as barriers to change do not, in fact, prevent change. If so, dynamic norms may alter diverse salient mechanisms of personal change, and encourage behavior change in diverse contexts. Investigating four domains—smokers' intention to quit, dietary choice, sleep-related behavior, and men's identification as feminist—Experiments 1–4 found that dynamic norms affected three well-established mechanisms of personal behavior change across contexts: the belief that personal change is possible (increased self-efficacy), the belief that change is important to others (injunctive norms), and the belief that change is compatible with one's social identity. In each case, change in the psychological process also statistically mediated change in personal interest and intentions to change. Experiment 5 tested our hypothesis that psychological barriers that loom large would be remedied most. Manipulating the salience of all three barriers within a single context, we found that dynamic norms had a larger impact on salient than less salient barriers. The results suggest that dynamic norms can help resolve diverse psychological barriers to encourage personal change, especially salient barriers. They may thus be a particularly robust source of social influence across contexts.",2019-05-01,2020-02-04T03:41:29Z,2020-02-04T03:41:43Z,2020-02-04T03:41:29Z,238-252,NA,NA,82,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Witnessing change,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WU5RP5WQ\Sparkman and Walton - 2019 - Witnessing change Dynamic norms help resolve dive.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CILAR9Y2\S0022103118300465.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Intervention; Social identity; Dynamic norms; Self-efficacy; Social influence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000068

Two½- and 3½-year-old children saw dynamic events and were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions (differing in orders of events) or one of two control conditions. They extended the verbs in the experimental conditions, and not the control conditions. Three ½-year-olds were more successful than 2½-year-olds, though the younger children could extend verbs. A more difficult task is segmenting dynamic action into subevents that could be relevant for a verb (e.g., finding “chopping” in a cooking scene). In Study 2, 2½-, 3½-, and 4½-year-old children were assigned to experimental conditions in which relevant events flowed into irrelevant events (or vice versa) or to a control. Two½-year-olds failed to extend the verbs at test, differing from the older children; children in experimental conditions extended the verbs while children in the control condition did not.

Does multiple object individuation operate only over bounded, separable objects or does it operate equally over connected features within a single object? While previous fMRI experiments suggest that connectedness affects the processing and enumeration of objects, recent behavioral and EEG studies demonstrated that parallel individuation occurs over both object parts and distinct objects. However, it is unclear whether individuation of object parts and distinct objects relies on a common or independent neural mechanisms. Using fMRI-based multivariate pattern analyses, we here demonstrate that activity patterns in inferior and superior intraparietal sulci (IPS) encode numerosity independently of whether the individuated items are connected parts of a single object or distinct objects. Lateral occipital cortex is more sensitive to perceptual aspects of the two stimulus types and the targets of the stimuli, suggesting a dissociation between ventral and dorsal areas in representing perceptual object properties and more general information about numerosity, respectively. Our results suggest that objecthood is not a necessary prerequisite for parallel individuation in IPS.

We created a novel Implicit Association Test to measure mental associations between homosexuality and promiscuity. We found that mental associations between homosexuality and promiscuity, at both the implicit and the explicit levels, interacted with short-term mating orientation to predict opposition to same-sex marriage.

We show that civil conflict risk in sub-Saharan Africa is negatively correlated with the number and density of weather stations contributing to a country's temperature record. This effect is both cross-sectional—countries with higher average conflict risk tend to have poorer coverage—and cross-temporal—civil conflict leads to loss of weather stations. Poor coverage induces a small downward bias in one widely used temperature data set, due to its interpolation method, and increases measurement error, potentially attenuating estimates of the temperature–conflict relationship. Combining multiple observational data sets to reduce measurement error almost doubles the estimated effect of temperature anomalies on civil conflict risk.",2019,2020-01-29T02:10:38Z,2020-01-29T02:11:11Z,2020-01-29T02:10:38Z,723-739,NA,4,63,NA,NA,Is Temperature Exogenous?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"©2019, Midwest Political Science Association",NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JM7J4DIH\Schultz and Mankin - 2019 - Is Temperature Exogenous The Impact of Civil Conf.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XNERI34T\ajps.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,OSBadgeOpenMaterialsPR,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000078

The UPR has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and is therefore actively investigated as therapeutic target. In this respect, cell non-autonomous effects of the UPR including the reported cell-to-cell transmission of UPR activity may be highly important. A pharmaca-based UPR induction was employed to generate conditioned media (CM) from CM-donating neuronal (‘donor’) cells (SK-N-SH and primary mouse neurons). As previously reported, upon subsequent transfer of CM to naive neuronal ‘acceptor’ cells, we confirmed UPR target mRNA and protein expression by qPCR and automated microscopy. However, UPR target gene expression was also induced in the absence of donor cells, indicating carry-over of pharmaca. Genetic induction of single pathways of the UPR in donor cells did not result in UPR transmission to acceptor cells. Moreover, no transmission was detected upon full UPR activation by nutrient deprivation or inducible expression of the heavy chain of immunoglobulin M in donor HeLa cells. In addition, in direct co-culture of donor cells expressing the immunoglobulin M heavy chain and fluorescent UPR reporter acceptor HeLa cells, UPR transmission was not observed. In conclusion, carry-over of pharmaca is a major confounding factor in pharmaca-based UPR transmission protocols that are therefore unsuitable to study cell-to-cell UPR transmission. In addition, the absence of UPR transmission in non-pharmaca-based models of UPR activation indicates that cell-to-cell UPR transmission does not occur in cell culture.",2020,2020-02-06T03:02:21Z,2020-02-06T03:02:42Z,2020-02-06T03:02:21Z,208-220,NA,2,152,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 The Authors.

The present study examined the longitudinal relation between individual differences in positive daily experiences and the Big Five personality traits. Data came from Dutch mothers (N = 483; M age = 44 years at T1) who completed up to six yearly personality questionnaires and 15 between-year assessment bursts, lasting five consecutive days each. Using multilevel structural equation modelling, we found that individual differences in daily experiences of positive affect and perceived relationship support/affection with partners and children were positively associated with subsequent rank-order changes in all Big Five personality traits. In contrast, we found little evidence that personality traits were associated with rank-order changes in daily experiences, which may be due to the very-high rank-order stability of positive affect and relationship support. Furthermore, positive daily experiences demonstrated incremental validity in predicting rank-order changes in trait agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness, over and above daily negative affect and relationship conflict. The results suggest that positive affective and interpersonal daily experiences contribute to positive personality trait changes in middle adulthood. We discuss these results in the context of contemporary theories of personality trait development. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2018-11-01,2019-03-20T17:43:28Z,2019-03-20T17:45:04Z,2019-03-20T17:43:27Z,672-689,NA,6,32,NA,European Journal of Personality,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LLH42N2P\Borghuis e.a. - 2018 - Positive Daily Experiences Are Associated with Per.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3UFVDVG3\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,personality development; social relationships; adulthood; daily diary; positive affect,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000081

However, questions have arisen over its robustness and about underlying mechanisms, particularly in relation to differences in past relationship experiences. In this report, the authors used an inductive approach, exploring individual differences to identify items that alter the temperature-social thought relationship in a pilot (Study 1), and confirming the effects in Study 2 (total N for 1 and 2 = 366), both of which were not pre-registered.

Recent studies of Danish, a language characterized by frequent long sequences of vocoids in speech, have suggested that the reduced occurrence of contoids may make speech in it intrinsically harder to segment than in closely related languages such as Norwegian. We addressed this hypothesis empirically in an artificial language learning experiment with native speakers of Danish, Norwegian, and English. We tested whether artificial speech consisting of concatenated contoid?vocoid syllables is easier to segment than speech consisting of vocoid?vocoid syllables where the first segment is a semivowel and the second a full vowel. Contrary to what was expected, we found no effect of the phonetic makeup of the syllables on speech segmentability. Possible interpretations and implications of this result are discussed.

These scenarios may be popular because people have their own beliefs and visions about the apocalypse and the need to prepare. The prevalence of such beliefs might also hold societal relevance and serve as a type of projective test of personality. However, there are no quantitative accounts of post-apocalyptic or prepping beliefs. As such, we conducted seven studies (Ntotal = 1034) to do so. In Studies 1 and 2, we developed a post-apocalyptic and prepping beliefs scale, explored its correlates, and confirmed its structure and psychometric properties. In Study 3, we attempted to activate a ‘prepper’ mindset and further explore the correlates of the new scale. In Studies 4 and 5, we investigated covariations in daily feelings, thoughts, and events, and prepping beliefs. In Studies 6a and 6b, we compared scores from ‘real’ preppers and to a non-prepping group. Overall, we found that post-apocalyptic concerns and prepping beliefs are predictive of low agreeableness and humility, paranoia, cynicism, conspiracy mentality, conservatism, and social dominance orientation. We also found that increased belief in the need to prep is associated with God-belief, negative daily experiences, and global political events. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:44:48Z,2020-01-30T12:46:18Z,2020-01-30T12:44:48Z,506-525,NA,4,33,NA,NA,On Post-apocalyptic and Doomsday Prepping Beliefs,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\B6YDEHXV\Fetterman et al. - 2019 - On Post-apocalyptic and Doomsday Prepping Beliefs.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CJ3JYXBA\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,personality; individual differences; cynicism; conspiracy mentality; doomsday prepping; post-apocalyptic beliefs,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000085

Due to its inconspicuous location and highly vascular anatomy, it has historically been difficult to study. Cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs), utilize low frequency stimulation to map cerebral networks. They were used to study connections of the human insula. Methods CCEP data was acquired from each sub-region of the dominant and non-dominant insula in 30 patients who underwent stereo-EEG. Connectivity strength to the various cortical regions was obtained via a measure of root mean square (RMS), calculated from each gyrus of the insula and ranked into weighted means. Results The results of all cumulative CCEP responses for each individual gyrus were represented by circro plots. Forty-nine individual CCEP pairs were stimulated across all the gyri from the right and left insula. In brief, the left insula contributed more greatly to language areas. Sensory function, pain, saliency processing and vestibular function were more heavily implicated from the right insula. Connections to the primary auditory cortex arose from both insula regions. Both posterior insula regions showed significant contralateral connectivity. Ipsilateral mesial temporal connections were seen from both insula regions. In visual function, we further report the novel finding of a direct connection between the right posterior insula and left visual cortex. Significance The insula is a major multi-modal network hub with the cerebral cortex having major roles in language, sensation, auditory, visual, limbic and vestibular functions as well as saliency processing. In temporal lobe epilepsy surgery failure, the insula may be implicated as an extra temporal cause, due to the strong mesial temporal connectivity findings.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:54:11Z,2020-01-30T11:12:04Z,2020-01-30T07:54:11Z,419-442,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,Connectivity of the human insula,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SSPX9QCF\Dionisio et al. - 2019 - Connectivity of the human insula A cortico-cortic.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UR6285SV\S0010945219302308.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Brain networks; Connectivity; Cortico-cortical evoked potentials; Epilepsy; Insula; Stereo-EEG,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000086

Moreover, we identified which types of items (e.g. dispositions, behaviours, and interests) are particularly prone to age effects. We reanalyzed the German Revised NEO Personality Inventory normative sample (N = 11,724) and applied a genetic algorithm to select short scales that yield acceptable model fit and reliability across locally weighted samples ranging from 16 to 66 years of age. We then examined how the item selection changes across age points and item types. Emotion-type items seemed to be interchangeable and generally applicable to people of all ages. Specific interests, attitudes, and social effect items—most prevalent within the domains of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Openness—seemed to be more prone to measurement variations over age.

Studies reporting this phenomenon have typically relied on checklists, where participants read event descriptions and indicate (yes/no) their exposure. We examined whether that approach is vulnerable to response biases and memory errors. In two experiments, participants viewed negative photos and completed an Old-New recognition test. In Experiment 1, participants completed either a photo recognition test or description test—composed of written descriptions of negative photos. In Experiment 2, we measured analogue PTSD symptoms and participants completed the description test twice, 24 hr apart.

We argue that valence-dependent learning asymmetries are partly driven by beliefs about the causal structure of the environment. If hidden causes can intervene to generate bad (or good) outcomes, then a rational observer will assign blame (or credit) to these hidden causes, rather than to the stable outcome distribution. Thus, a rational observer should learn less from bad outcomes when they are likely to have been generated by a hidden cause, and this pattern should reverse when hidden causes are likely to generate good outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments (N = 80, N = 255) in which we explicitly manipulated the behavior of hidden agents. This gave rise to both kinds of learning asymmetries in the same paradigm, as predicted by a novel Bayesian model. These results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how causal attributions contribute to biased learning.",2019-04-01,2020-01-29T05:39:30Z,2020-01-29T05:39:46Z,2020-01-29T05:39:30Z,516-525,NA,4,30,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3TK8JPT2\Dorfman et al. - 2019 - Causal Inference About Good and Bad Outcomes.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,attribution; decision making; Bayesian inference; open data; open materials; preregistered; agency; reinforcement learning,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000089

The present research tested whether young children are influenced by adults’ nonverbal behaviors when making inferences about peers. In Study 1, participants (aged 5–6 years) viewed multiple videos of interactions between a “teacher” and two “students”; all individuals were unfamiliar to participants. In each clip, the students behaved similarly, but the teacher did not: She either smiled, nodded, touched, or shook her head at one student, and she looked at the other student with a neutral expression. In Study 1, children tended to infer that students who received more positive behaviors from the teacher were smarter, nicer, and stronger. Study 2 pitted differences in the teacher’s behavior against differences in the students’ performance. When asked who was smarter, children selected lower-performing students who received more positive nonverbal cues from the teacher rather than higher-performing students who received less positive cues.

We first manipulated perceived issue polarization between two candidates in a fictional election to be high, medium, or low and showed that the high and low polarization conditions, compared to the medium condition, evoked greater desire for inclusion of a third candidate. Then we established that perceiving the electoral system as broken statistically mediated the effect of high and low polarization on greater desire for inclusion. We next demonstrated experimental mediation in two ways: via a manipulation-of-mediator design (Pirlott & MacKinnon, 2016) in which we manipulated the proposed mediator (i.e., perceived electoral system brokenness) and, separately, via a moderation-of process design (Spencer, Zanna, & Fong, 2005) in which we simultaneously manipulated both perceived polarization and perceived brokenness. Both perceived issue polarization (high and low versus medium, and high versus low, excluding medium) and perceived brokenness exert causal effects on greater desire for inclusion of a third party candidate.

These compounds may both inhibit and potentiate the activity of P2XRs, but sex steroids such as 17β-estradiol or progesterone are reported to be inactive. Here, we tested a hypothesis that testosterone, another sex hormone, modulates activity of P2XRs. We examined actions of native testosterone and a series of testosterone derivatives on the gating of recombinant P2X2R, P2X4R and P2X7R and native channels expressed in pituitary cells and hypothalamic neurons. The 17β-ester derivatives of testosterone rapidly and positively modulate the 1 µM ATP-evoked currents in P2X2R- and P2X4R-expressing cells, but not agonist-evoked currents in P2X7R-expressing cells. In general, most of the tested testosterone derivatives are more potent modulators than endogenous testosterone. The comparison of chemical structures and whole-cell recordings revealed that their interactions with P2XRs depend on the lipophilicity and length of the alkyl chain at position C-17. Pre-treatment with testosterone butyrate or valerate increases the sensitivity of P2X2R and P2X4R to ATP by several fold, reduces the rate of P2X4R desensitization, accelerates resensitization, and enhances ethidium uptake by P2X4R. Native channels are also potentiated by testosterone derivatives, while endogenously expressed GABA receptors type A are inhibited. The effect of ivermectin, a P2X4R-specific allosteric modulator, on deactivation is antagonized by testosterone derivatives in a concentration-dependent manner. Together, our results provide evidence for potentiation of particular subtypes of P2XRs by testosterone derivatives and suggest a potential role of ivermectin binding site for steroid-induced modulation.

Even if actors are uncertain of each other's preferences, they know what types of actions the other will view as cooperative. Yet on many real-world issues, cooperation is subjective, and what constitutes a cooperative action is conditional on the receiver's preferences. We present a formal model showing that in these cases, two-sided incomplete information actually incentivizes honest behavior and facilitates credible signaling. Because uncertain senders do not know whether a particular action will be interpreted as cooperative, they have little incentive to misrepresent, and instead honestly pursue their true goals. Thus, where cooperation is subjective, mutual uncertainty is “offsetting,” such that credible signals allow actors to quickly and accurately update their beliefs.

This research shows that individual differences in self?compassion, as measured by the Self?Compassion Scale (SCS), are positively related to life satisfaction, health and social functioning. However, a critical and systematic test of self?compassion from a personality perspective has not yet conducted so far. In the present study (N = 576), we (i) tested the factor structure of the SCS, (ii) examined the distinctiveness of self?compassion with regard to the five?factor model of personality, focusing on neuroticism, and (iii) tested the incremental predictive power of self?compassion beyond the five?factor model in the context of life satisfaction. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a two?factor plus six facets solution of self?compassion (a positive factor and a negative factor). Additional analyses revealed that the negative factor was redundant with facets of neuroticism (rs ≥ .85), whereas the positive factor had some unique variance left. However, neither the negative factor nor the positive factor could explain substantial incremental variance in life satisfaction beyond neuroticism. Recommendations for how to use the SCS are provided, and the future of research on self?compassion is discussed.

Although such efforts to avoid appearing partial can often reduce biases, we argue that, at times, such efforts can actually lead people to be biased against their friends. We theorize that people do so because they recognize that benefitting their friends may be viewed by others as partial. This argument makes two key predictions, which we investigated in eight studies using workplace scenarios. First, we predicted and found that, when the decision was public, allocators were reluctant to give a bonus to a deserving employee when that employee was a friend rather than a non-friend. In private, however, participants were willing to give the bonus to the deserving person whether she was a friend or a non-friend, suggesting that their public behavior was aimed at avoiding the appearance of bias. Second, we predicted and found that allocators' reluctance to give a bonus to a deserving friend is mediated by their beliefs that others would find this behavior to be unfair.

One way to choose an effect size for power analyses is by relying on pilot data. A-priori power analyses are only accurate when the effect size estimate is accurate. In this paper we highlight two sources of bias when performing a-priori power analyses for between-subject designs based on pilot data. First, we examine how the choice of the effect size index (η2, ω2 and ε2) affects the sample size and power of the main study. Based on our observations, we recommend against the use of η2 in a-priori power analyses. Second, we examine how the maximum sample size researchers are willing to collect in a main study (e.g. due to time or financial constraints) leads to overestimated effect size estimates in the studies that are performed. Determining the required sample size exclusively based on the effect size estimates from pilot data, and following up on pilot studies only when the sample size estimate for the main study is considered feasible, creates what we term follow-up bias. We explain how follow-up bias leads to underpowered main studies. Our simulations show that designing main studies based on effect sizes estimated from small pilot studies does not yield desired levels of power due to accuracy bias and follow-up bias, even when publication bias is not an issue. We urge researchers to consider alternative approaches to determining the sample size of their studies, and discuss several options.",2018-01-01,2018-04-05T23:52:48Z,2018-04-05T23:52:59Z,2018-04-05T23:52:48Z,187-195,NA,NA,74,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,When power analyses based on pilot data are biased,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TH8J6SEE\Albers and Lakens - 2018 - When power analyses based on pilot data are biased.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SSYEZBP7\S002210311630230X.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Effect size; Epsilon-squared; Eta-squared; Follow-up bias; Omega-squared; Power analysis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000102

Are social decisions subject to the same violations, and if so, what account best characterizes the nature of the violations? Across five studies, we tested whether decision-makers exhibit context-dependent preferences in hiring scenarios and past U.S. congressional race outcomes and compared different models of value coding as sources of the hypothesized context-dependence. Studies 1a, 1b, and 1d revealed that a divisive normalization value coding scheme best characterized participants' choices across a series of hiring decisions, and that participants exhibited context-dependent preferences. However, the distractor had the opposite effect of that predicted by divisive normalization once we accounted for the random effect of participant: as the value of the distractor increased, participants were more likely to hire the highest-valued candidate. In Study 2, we used a combination of archival electoral data and survey data to examine whether normalization models could explain the outcomes of congressional elections. Electoral outcomes were predicted by political candidates' inferred competence, but this time in line with the divisive normalization account.

We additionally tested whether planfulness uniquely relates to activity when compared with related constructs. Finally, ratings of participants’ written goals were correlated with these personality traits and physical activity.

However, little is known about how trust can be fostered. One cognitive process that has been suggested as a precursor of trust is perspective-taking, but experimental evidence for a causal relation between the two constructs is missing. In the present article, we investigated whether perspective-taking increases trust in strangers and known interaction partners. Perspective-taking should lead to trust, because it has been shown to increase liking of other people, which itself is an important antecedent of trust. In three high-powered experiments (total N = 612), we investigated the effects of perspective-taking on trust using a novel visuo-spatial manipulation of perspective-taking. In Experiment 1, participants reported feeling more trust for a stranger after engaging in visuo-spatial perspective-taking compared to trials where they remained in their egocentric perspective. Experiment 2 supported the above-mentioned theoretical mechanism that trust in a stranger is increased due to liking and generalized the results from self-reported trust to behavioral trust within a trust game. Experiment 3 demonstrated an important boundary condition of this effect by showing that when the trustworthiness of another person is concurrently directly manipulated by giving participants information about how the other person has behaved in the past, the effects of perspective-taking on behavioral trust vanish, and while its effects on self-reported liking and trust remain intact, they are small in comparison to the effects of direct trustworthiness manipulations on self-reported liking and trust.",2018-11-01,2019-03-30T16:52:27Z,2019-03-30T16:52:36Z,2019-03-30T16:52:27Z,34-41,NA,NA,79,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SZYX983I\Erle e.a. - 2018 - The effects of visuo-spatial perspective-taking on.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I2L5FW7X\S0022103118300441.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Empathy; Trust; Perspective-taking; Theory of mind; Trust game,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000109

A decreased synthesis of the NMDA-R co-agonist d-serine was recently proposed to contribute to alterations of hippocampus-dependent memory mechanisms with ageing. Nevertheless, other pathways could also be involved and thus considered to be targets of interest to prevent cognitive ageing. Herein, we demonstrate that the Asc-1 subtype of neutral amino acid (nAA) transporters that regulates d-serine and glycine release from neurons could be viewed as one of these targets. At CA3/CA1 hippocampal synapses, Asc-1 activation did not modify basal glutamate neurotransmission either in adult or aged rats. In contrast, Asc-1 activation significantly increased NMDA-R-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in both groups of animals and fully rescued the age-related LTP deficits. This rescue in aged animals was observed only when Asc-1 activation was selectively managed by d-Isoleucine (d-Ile), but not when less specifically driven by a mixture of nAA. Similarly, while any activation of Asc-1 improved the isolated NMDA-R-induced synaptic potentials in adult rats, only d-Ile was efficient in aged animals. Taken together, these results strengthen the interest in specifically targeting Asc-1 transporters to better cure age-associated memory decline.

We used the social relations model (SRM) to analyze data from 187 participants. In face-to-face groups of four, participants rated their own and others’ FA. We assessed the degree of FA enhancement using unconfounded measures of both self-insight and social comparison. Results indicated African Americans and men enhanced more than Caucasians and women. Race effects were mediated by psychological adjustment, while gender effects were related to meta-perceptions. Men tended to view themselves through a “frog prince” lens, such that they accurately predicted others’ lesser views of them but persisted in overly positive self-perceptions of FA.

College students (N = 939) participated in a preregistered, four-wave longitudinal study over one academic year. Depression positively predicted subsequent derailment across all components of the model, suggesting that perceived disruptions in life course may occur in response to elevated depressive symptoms. Contrary to predictions, derailment negatively predicted later depression across most waves, indicating that felt changes in identity and self-direction could buffer against downstream mood deteriorations.

The findings suggest that, although length of instruction correlated positively with vocabulary knowledge in English and French, the gains remained modest when out-of-school exposure to the foreign language input was limited. Despite fewer years of English instruction, participants’ vocabulary knowledge in English was considerably larger than their French vocabulary knowledge, which can be explained by their large amounts of out-of-school exposure to English language input. Participants’ online activities in particular had a positive effect on their vocabulary knowledge in English. Although gender influenced participants’ engagement with online activities in English, gender did not have a direct effect on their vocabulary knowledge, as the structural equation modeling analysis showed.

Specifically, as proposed by the self?other knowledge asymmetry model, an incremental predictive ability of informants is most likely for traits and corresponding behaviours that are clearly visible to others and highly evaluative in nature. In two studies, we provide an empirical test of this proposition and extend prior research to one of the most important domains of interpersonal interaction: prosocial and moral behaviours. Specifically, we investigate the unique predictive power of informant reports in trait Honesty?Humility for fairness in the dictator game and dishonesty in a cheating paradigm. Importantly, while both these classes of behaviour are highly evaluative in nature, only fairness is clearly visible to others. Correspondingly, in line with the self?other knowledge asymmetry model, our results reveal unique predictive accuracy of informant reports for fairness. For dishonesty, by contrast, there was no conclusive evidence for incremental predictive power of informant reports. This implies that informants may indeed provide valuable information beyond targets' self?reports on trait aspects driving fair behaviour, but that targets themselves are their own best experts when it comes to judging trait aspects driving dishonest behaviour.

In the present study, we investigated whether this effect could be attributed to a disruption in the ease with which benchmarks on the number line can be determined and whether this possible disruption changes with age. Hence, we asked 5th graders and adults to perform a NLE task in a typical and an atypical condition with a number line ranging from 0 to 1,000 and from 367 to 1,367, respectively. Results showed that participants’ overall estimates were less accurate in the atypical condition compared to the typical condition. A similar pattern of results was observed for the estimates around the self-created benchmarks at 50% in children and at 25%, 50%, and 75% in adults. Moreover, in both age groups, we found a shift from a larger proportion of estimation patterns’ being best fit by more complex power models in the typical condition toward a larger proportion of estimation patterns best described by simpler power models in the atypical condition. Of importance, we also found evidence that adults’ estimation patterns in the typical condition are best described by a 4-cycle power model, hereby extending previous modeling results. Overall, our findings indicate that hindering the application of benchmark-based strategies negatively affects children’s and adults’ NLE performance.

Sometimes, though, initial interpretations turn out to be wrong. How do listeners revise misinterpretations of language input moment by moment to avoid comprehension errors? Cognitive control may play a role by detecting when processing has gone awry and then initiating behavioral adjustments accordingly. However, no research to date has investigated a cause-and-effect interplay between cognitive-control engagement and the overriding of erroneous interpretations in real time. Using a novel cross-task paradigm, we showed that Stroop-conflict detection, which mobilizes cognitive-control procedures, subsequently facilitates listeners’ incremental processing of temporarily ambiguous spoken instructions that induce brief misinterpretation. When instructions followed incongruent Stroop items, compared with congruent Stroop items, listeners’ eye movements to objects in a scene reflected more transient consideration of the false interpretation and earlier recovery of the correct one. Comprehension errors also decreased.

We hypothesize that nicotine can also dysregulate brain parenchymal glucose utilization by altering glucose transporters with effects on sensitivity to ischemic stroke. In this study, we investigated the effects of nicotine exposure on neuronal glucose utilization using an in vitro ischemic stroke model. We also tested the effects of e-Cig vaping on ischemic brain glucose utilization using an acute brain slice technique. Primary cortical neurons and brain slices were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation to mimic ischemia-reperfusion injury. We estimated brain cell glucose utilization by measuring the uptake of [3H] deoxy-d-glucose. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were done to characterize glucose transporters (GLUTs) and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression. Furthermore, we used a glycolytic stress test to measure the effects of nicotine exposure on neuronal glucose metabolism. We observed that short- and long-term nicotine/cotinine exposure significantly decreased neuronal glucose utilization in ischemic conditions and the non-specific nAChR antagonist, mecamylamine reversed this effect. Nicotine/cotinine exposure also decreased neuronal GLUT1 and up-regulated α7 nAChR expression and decreased glycolysis. Exposure of mice to e-Cig vapor for 7 days likewise decreases brain glucose uptake under normoxic and ischemic conditions along with down-regulation of GLUT1 and GLUT3 expressions. These data support, from a cerebrovascular perspective, that nicotine and/or e-Cig vaping induce a state of glucose deprivation at the neurovascular unit which could lead to enhanced ischemic brain injury and/or stroke risk.

This attribution decision influences one's opinion of the object (I like him). Misattribution occurs when the internal experience is triggered by one object (a prime), but attributed to another (a target). The present research used the Affect Misattribution Procedure to examine the influence of conceptual overlap between the prime and the target on misattribution of valenced internal experiences. For instance, would people misattribute the pleasure activated by a flower prime to a target flower more than to a person? We argue that the valence of the internal experience does not enter the attribution process alone, but is rather accompanied by semantic properties related to the object that generated the experience. Consequently, misattribution occurs more when prime and target are conceptually similar. Four experiments (Total N = 3183) supported that prediction, using diverse primes and targets. The results suggest that the semantic properties of the internal experience help guide the attribution process.",2019-07-01,2020-02-06T01:34:49Z,2020-02-10T11:50:11Z,2020-02-06T01:34:49Z,1-10,NA,NA,83,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SMGPX23A\Ecker and Bar-Anan - 2019 - Conceptual overlap between stimuli increases misat.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\U5K3XLJM\S0022103118304815.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Attribution; Priming; Implicit measures; Affect misattribution procedure; Misattribution,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000121

Five studies examined whether and how people incorporate subjective, descriptive norms of behavior into their moral evaluations and mental state inferences of an agent's actions. We used experimental norm manipulations (Studies 1–2, 4), cultural differences in tipping norms (Study 3), and behavioral economic games (Study 5). Across studies, people increased the magnitude of their moral judgments when an agent exceeded a descriptive norm and decreased the magnitude when an agent fell below a norm (Studies 1–4). Moreover, this differentiation was partially explained via perceptions of agents' desires (Studies 1–2); it emerged only when the agent was aware of the norm (Study 4); and it generalized to explain decisions of trust for real monetary stakes (Study 5). Together, these findings indicate that moral actions are evaluated in relation to what most other people do rather than solely in relation to morally objective rules.",2018-07-01,2019-03-30T16:23:39Z,2019-03-30T16:23:53Z,2019-03-30T16:23:39Z,1-10,NA,NA,77,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"It's not what you do, but what everyone else does",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NUSC2ZUX\Monroe e.a. - 2018 - It's not what you do, but what everyone else does.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DNFTPR27\S0022103117302275.html",NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Social cognition; Norms; Moral judgment; Blame-praise asymmetries; Mental state inference,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000122

Recent research has suggested that age-related differences in hindsight bias may be based on age-related differences in inhibitory control. We tested whether this explanation held for 3 cognitive processes assumed to underlie hindsight bias: recollection bias, reconstruction bias, and the tendency to adopt newly acquired knowledge as old. We performed a typical hindsight-bias study with 9-year-olds, 12-year-olds, young adults, and older adults. Participants first gave numerical judgments to difficult almanac questions. They later received the correct judgments for some of the questions while trying to recall their own earlier judgments. To experimentally test the impact of inhibitory control, the correct judgment was presented either in a weak or in a strong manner that was difficult to ignore. Hindsight bias was larger in the strong condition than in the weak condition and followed a U-shaped life-span pattern with young adults showing the least hindsight bias in line with an inhibitory-control explanation. Yet, the mixture of underlying processes differed considerably between age groups, so inhibitory control did not suffice as a sole explanation of age differences.",2018-05-27,2019-04-03T08:19:19Z,2019-04-03T08:19:54Z,2019-04-03T08:19:19Z,278-300,NA,3,19,NA,NA,Age Differences in Processes Underlying Hindsight Bias,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YXT3YKGH\Pohl et al. - 2018 - Age Differences in Processes Underlying Hindsight .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A6F6JDP8\15248372.2018.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000123

Two studies examine the role of inferred I-sharing in the minimal group paradigm. We found that (1) people inferred that they would I-share with ingroup members more than outgroup members; (2) inferred I-sharing increased ingroup favoritism; and (3) inferred I-sharing accounted for this ingroup favoritism. Moreover, expecting to I-share with the outgroup improved participants’ attitudes toward the outgroup.

Critically, previous studies have included either verbal or gesture production in the training. However, while in speakers without language impairment, action naming is facilitated by gesture observation, no study has yet systematically determined whether gesture observation alone influences word retrieval in people with aphasia. This is the aim of the research presented here. In a gesture priming experiment, participants with aphasia named actions that were preceded by the observation of videos of congruent or unrelated gestures or a non-gesture control condition. At the group-level, action naming was facilitated by observation of congruent gestures. However, single-case analyses revealed variability in the extent to which the participants benefited from gesture cueing. The potential mechanisms underlying the effects of gesture observation on action picture naming in people with aphasia were examined by exploring participant-related and item-related predictors of improvement. It is concluded that gesture observation may facilitate verb retrieval at either semantic or lexical levels. In addition, and despite variability across individuals, gesture observation seems more likely to facilitate action naming in people with spared gesture semantics and mild-moderate deficits in lexical-semantic or post-semantic processing.",2020-02-01,2020-02-06T01:22:20Z,2020-02-06T01:22:38Z,2020-02-06T01:22:20Z,86-112,NA,NA,123,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VI53RWTA\Murteira and Nickels - 2020 - Can gesture observation help people with aphasia n.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4UGAY8L8\S0010945219303569.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Aphasia; Action naming; Gestures; Language impairment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000126

Other cognitive deficits, including amnesia, have no measurable impact on identity persistence. Accordingly, frontotemporal dementia has the greatest effect on perceived identity, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has the least.

While low-level stimulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is protective, sustained UPR activation resulting from prolonged ER stress can promote neurotoxicity. The cell-autonomous mechanisms of the UPR have been extensively characterized. However, the cell-extrinsic role of the UPR under physiological and pathological states in the CNS remains to be elucidated. To begin to address this, we evaluated if transferring conditioned media between ER-stressed astrocytes and neurons could modulate their functional characteristics. Our results indicate that ER-stressed astrocytes and neurons secrete a molecule(s) with lipid characteristics which regulates both inflammatory and ER stress responses in other astrocytes, neurons, and microglia in vitro. Initial exposure to this stress factor(s) confers resistance against subsequent ER stress to neurons. However, persistent exposure to this unidentified mediator(s) suppresses the initial protective effect and becomes cytotoxic. Overall, these findings provide insight into the cell non-autonomous influence of ER stress on cells of the central nervous system.

Our paper provides evidence of a link between an organization's culture—specifically the trust environment—and its level of specialization. We show experimentally that exogenously-imposed culture endogenously leads to variation in organizational form. We prime trust and demonstrate that the level of trust within an organization affects division of labor and consequently productivity in nonhierarchical teams. This evidence is consistent with a cross-country link between trust and the division of labor that we observe in data from the European Social Survey. Managerial Summary Firms vary among many dimensions such as culture and internal organization even within the same industry. Trust is one component of corporate culture that is crucial for cooperation within organizations. In this paper, we show that the trust dimension of corporate culture can affect firm performance through internal structure, in particular the degree of division of labor. Using evidence from a game-theoretic model, a lab experiment, and country-level data, we show that an increase in trust leads to increased worker specialization. Our results suggest that increasing trust in work environments where division of labor is beneficial is one way to boost team productivity.

We tested these accounts by investigating whether anger and disgust vary depending on the costs imposed by moral violations and whether they differentially correspond with aggressive tendencies. Results across four studies favor a sociofunctional account: When the target of a moral violation shifts from the self to another person, anger decreases, but disgust increases. Whereas anger is associated with high-cost, direct aggression, disgust is associated with less costly indirect aggression.

In addition, age-differential socialization effects associated with six first-time life events were investigated. Analyses revealed substantial age differences in all four aspects of change. As expected, emerging adults showed greater change and diversity in change than young adults. However, the six life events had no age-differential impact on change in single traits and Big Five profiles.

The theory holds that individuals with growth mind-sets (beliefs that attributes are malleable with effort) enjoy many positive outcomes—including higher academic achievement—while their peers who have fixed mind-sets experience negative outcomes. Given this relationship, interventions designed to increase students’ growth mind-sets—thereby increasing their academic achievement—have been implemented in schools around the world. In our first meta-analysis (k = 273, N = 365,915), we examined the strength of the relationship between mind-set and academic achievement and potential moderating factors.

The present research challenges this principle by demonstrating a too-much-precision effect. Five experiments (involving 1,320 experts and amateurs in real-estate, jewelry, car, and human-resources negotiations) showed that increasing the precision of an opening offer had positive linear effects for amateurs but inverted-U-shaped effects for experts. Anchor precision backfired because experts saw too much precision as reflecting a lack of competence. This negative effect held unless first movers gave rationales that boosted experts’ perception of their competence. Statistical mediation and experimental moderation established the critical role of competence attributions. This research disentangles competing theoretical accounts (attribution of competence vs. scale granularity) and qualifies two putative truisms: that anchors affect experts and amateurs equally, and that more precise prices are linearly more potent anchors.

This report presents the results of fieldwork carried out on behalf of the Department of Archaeology, University of York, between 1993-5, including field walking, geophysical survey, and excavation. This revealed an enclosure of the eighth-ninth centuries, containing traces of a small number of post-built halls. In the late ninth century this settlement was then abandoned, a process which led to the incorporation of a human female skull in a domestic rubbish pit. A new enclosed settlement was laid out nearby, which was occupied briefly in the early tenth century. It is argued that the Anglian settlement may have been part of a royal multiple estate but that as a result of estate reorganisation after the Scandinavian settlement it developed into an independent manor. Cottam is the first so-called 'productive site' in the environs of York to be the subject of archaeological investigations.

Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals.

The present study investigated the clinical applicability of these factors to naming treatment in aphasia. Prior studies have shown that naming treatment that provides retrieval practice (i.e., practice retrieving names for objects from semantic memory) improves later naming performance in people with aphasia (PWA) more so than repetition training. Repetition training is a common form of naming treatment that can support errorless production of names for objects, but it does not provide retrieval practice. Prior work has also demonstrated enhanced naming treatment benefit in PWA when an item's training trials are separated by multiple intervening trials (i.e., spacing) compared to only one intervening trial (i.e., massing). However, in those studies, items were only trained in one session. Also, the effects of the learning factors were probed after one day and one week. The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of retrieval practice and spacing in a more clinically-inspired schedule of delivery and to assess the effects of the learning factors at retention intervals of greater functional significance. Matched sets of errorful items for each of four PWA were presented for multiple trials of retrieval practice or repetition in a spaced or massed schedule in each of multiple training sessions. Mixed regression analyses revealed that retrieval practice outperformed repetition, and spacing outperformed massing, at an initial post-treatment test administered after one week. Furthermore, the advantage for retrieval practice over repetition persisted at a follow-up test administered after one month. The potential clinical relevance of retrieval practice and spacing for multi-session interventions in speech-language treatment is discussed.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:36:48Z,2020-01-30T07:40:45Z,2020-01-30T07:36:48Z,386-400,NA,NA,119,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JMLPT3MP\Middleton et al. - 2019 - Retrieval practice and spacing effects in multi-se.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NJP6VNAX\S0010945219302552.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Aphasia; Lexical access; Naming treatment; Retrieval practice; Spacing effect,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000145

We showed that a mutualism model, which proposes that basic cognitive abilities directly and positively interact during development, provides the best account of developmental changes. We found that individuals with higher scores in vocabulary showed greater gains in matrix reasoning and vice versa. These dynamic coupling pathways are not predicted by other accounts and provide a novel mechanistic window into cognitive development.",2017-10-01,2018-03-20T00:01:25Z,2018-03-20T00:02:14Z,2018-03-20T00:01:25Z,1419-1431,NA,10,28,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AMYIAJXF\Kievit et al. - 2017 - Mutualistic Coupling Between Vocabulary and Reason.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000146

We integrated theory on the functional benefits of group membership with a process termed the innuendo effect (Kervyn et al., 2012) to test how the absence of warmth or competence information shapes desire for group membership. Across three studies (Study 1a, N = 185; Study 1b, N = 359; Study 2, N = 429), we used an experimental vignette methodology in which people were randomly assigned to read descriptions that either emphasized an affiliation (i.e., intimacy group) or achievement (i.e., task group) context, and then subsequently emphasized a group's warmth, competence, or generally positive characteristics (i.e., control condition). For evaluations of both intimacy and task groups relative to a control condition, groups were perceived to lack warmth when described as highly competent, and groups were perceived to lack competence when described as highly warm. Though the direct effect of using innuendo on desire to join produced mixed results across studies, the mediation analyses in Studies 1b and 2 show that providing positive information about a group's warmth or competence, but omitting the contextually salient dimension of social perception (i.e., omission of warmth for intimacy groups and competence for task groups), indirectly weakened people's desire to join the group. Overall, this suggests that the innuendo effect generalizes to judgments of voluntary small groups, highlighting that failing to provide information about one of the dimensions of social perception (i.e., warmth or competence) can promote less favorable evaluations on that omitted dimension – even when descriptions contain wholly positive information.",2019-11-01,2020-02-06T01:56:29Z,2020-02-10T04:54:44Z,2020-02-06T01:56:28Z,103854,NA,NA,85,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D4VAUK2N\Benson et al. - 2019 - How innuendo shapes impressions of task and intima.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D24YF7H3\S0022103119301635.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Communication; Competence; Groups; Innuendo effect; Warmth,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000148

Adenosine A1 receptor agonists promote hibernation in different mammalian species, and the understanding of the mechanism inducing hibernation will inform clinical strategies to manipulate metabolic demand that are fundamental to conditions such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and therapeutic hypothermia. Adenosine A1 receptor agonist-induced hibernation in Arctic ground squirrels is regulated by an endogenous circannual (seasonal) rhythm. This study aims to identify the neuronal mechanism underlying the seasonal difference in response to the adenosine A1 receptor agonist. Arctic ground squirrels were implanted with body temperature transmitters and housed at constant ambient temperature (2°C) and light cycle (4L:20D). We administered CHA (N6-cyclohexyladenosine), an adenosine A1 receptor agonist in euthermic-summer phenotype and euthermic-winter phenotype and used cFos and phenotypic immunoreactivity to identify cell groups affected by season and treatment. We observed lower core and subcutaneous temperature in winter animals and CHA produced a hibernation-like response in winter, but not in summer. cFos-ir was greater in the median preoptic nucleus and the raphe pallidus in summer after CHA. CHA administration also resulted in enhanced cFos-ir in the nucleus tractus solitarius and decreased cFos-ir in the tuberomammillary nucleus in both seasons. In winter, cFos-ir was greater in the supraoptic nucleus and lower in the raphe pallidus than in summer. The seasonal decrease in the thermogenic response to CHA and the seasonal increase in vasoconstriction, assessed by subcutaneous temperature, reflect the endogenous seasonal modulation of the thermoregulatory systems necessary for CHA-induced hibernation.

Across six studies, we discovered a reversal of the bias depending on contextual and personal factors. Strivers, rather than naturals, are favored when evaluating ordinary people. This preference is particularly strong among perceivers who have experience in the performance domain, and it replicates across different domains and participant populations. Strivers are also preferred as cooperative partners and are expected to perform better on novel, unrelated tasks. The direction of the preference for naturals versus strivers can be traced to a combination of the perceiver's experience and the target's professional status. Specifically, a naturalness bias was only present among experienced perceivers evaluating professional targets. On the other hand, a more implicit form of the naturalness bias was observed in attributions made about the target's achievement, such that strivers were assumed to have natural talent more than naturals were assumed to have worked diligently.",2018-09-01,2019-03-30T16:42:07Z,2019-03-30T16:42:14Z,2019-03-30T16:42:07Z,134-147,NA,NA,78,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8CYXAQD8\Brown e.a. - 2018 - Contextual and personal determinants of preferring.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\H7VS3HCX\S0022103117305413.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Essentialism; Natural talent; Naturalness bias; Naturals; Strivers,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000152

Effortful thinking has been shown to help reduce anchoring effects, in which people form social judgments by adjusting from an initial value (the anchor). We therefore predicted that ego depletion would reduce the amount of adjustment from an initial anchor, leaving the final judgment relatively close to the anchor value. In contrast to previous research by Banker et al. (2017), we excluded alternative explanations, such as social mechanisms. In particular, we tested adjustment from internally generated and externally provided anchors. We theorized that judgment adjustment processes are the same for both internal and external cues. The results showed that neither self-generated nor experimenter-provided anchors were affected by ego depletion, thus leaving social mechanisms as the prime alternative explanation. The data also showed that susceptibility to anchoring is not a trait because reactions to different anchors were not substantially intercorrelated. Further, providing externally or internally generated anchors did not make a fundamental difference. However, the loss of data was higher with self-generated anchors.

According to the racial priming theory, this racialized counterstrategy should deactivate racism, thereby decreasing racially conservative whites’ support for the candidate engaged in race baiting. We propose an alternative theory in which racial liberals, and not racially conservative whites, are persuaded by this strategy. To test our theory, we focused on the 2016 presidential election. We ran an experiment varying the politician (by party and race) calling an implicit racial appeal by Donald Trump racist.

Rather, it causes racially liberal whites to evaluate Trump more unfavorably. Our results hold up when attentiveness, old-fashioned racism, and partisanship are taken into account.

Despite the importance of blindsight in the study of consciousness, little is known about the nature of patients' experience in their hemianopic field. To address this knowledge gap, we measured blindsight, and assessed the perceptual experience in the contralesional visual field, of seventeen homonymous hemianopic (HH) patients. To ensure that the stimuli were shown in a “blind” sector of the visual field, we selected a subgroup of eight complete-HH patients, as determined by automatic perimetry. Firstly, we measured blindsight through a forced-choice task in which the patients had to identify letters displayed on a screen. Secondly, we compared the patients' binary responses (“Something was presented” vs “Nothing was presented”) to responses on a new, five-level scale, the Sensation Awareness Scale (SAS), which we designed to include visual as well as non-visual answers (e.g., “I felt something”). Interestingly, only one of the eight complete-HH patients met the criteria for blindsight. More importantly, our SAS enabled us to identify a previously unreported dissociation, which we have named blindsense, in four of the eight complete-HH patients. Specifically, these four patients exhibited better-than-chance sensitivity to the presence of a stimulus on the subjective scale, despite being unable to identify the stimulus during the forced-choice task. Our findings highlight the importance of awareness-assessment methods to investigate perceptual experiences in the contralesional visual field and suggest a low incidence of blindsight in post-stroke HH patients.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:17:40Z,2020-01-30T07:18:01Z,2020-01-30T07:17:40Z,299-310,NA,NA,117,NA,Cortex,Dissociation between objective and subjective perceptual experiences in a population of hemianopic patients,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EUMQKL37\Garric et al. - 2019 - Dissociation between objective and subjective perc.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S93NUK62\S001094521930200X.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Awareness; Blind visual field; Blindsight; Hemianopia; Post-chiasmatic lesion,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000158

We addressed this question using the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), which provides a discernible measure of visuocortical activation to multiple stimuli simultaneously. Fifty-six adults were asked to remember a set of two oriented gratings. During the retention interval, two frequency-tagged oriented gratings were presented to probe the visuocortical processing of matching versus mismatching orientations relative to the memory set. Matching probes prompted an increased visuocortical response, whereas mismatching stimuli were suppressed. This suggests that the visual cortex prioritizes attentional selection of memory-relevant features at the expense of non-memory-relevant features. When two memory items were probed simultaneously, visuocortical amplification alternated between the two stimuli at a rate of 3 Hz to 4 Hz, consistent with the rate of attentional sampling of sensory events from the external world.

The origins of linguistic productivity have been a subject of heated debate: Whereas generativist accounts posit that children’s early language reflects the presence of syntactic abstractions, constructivist approaches instead emphasize gradual generalization derived from frequently heard forms. In the present research, we developed a Bayesian statistical model that measures the degree of abstraction implicit in children’s early use of the determiners “a” and “the.” Our work revealed that many previously used corpora are too small to allow researchers to judge between these theoretical positions. However, several data sets, including the Speechome corpus—a new ultra-dense data set for one child—showed evidence of low initial levels of productivity and higher levels later in development.

The aurora kinases A (AURKA), B (AURKB), and C (AURKC) are potential therapeutic targets in proliferating cells. However, their role has not been clarified in microglia. The aim of this study was to examine the regulation of aurora kinases and their roles and druggability in spinal microgliosis and neuropathic pain. Sprague–Dawley rats received chronic constriction injury (CCI). Gene expression of aurora kinases A-C was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot, respectively, in spinal cords at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after CCI. AURKB gene and protein expression was up-regulated concomitantly with the development of spinal microgliosis and neuropathic pain. Using lentiviral over-expression and adeno-associated viral knockdown approaches, the function of AURKB was further investigated by western blot, immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, and pain behavior tests. We found that AURKB over-expression in naive rats caused spinal microgliosis and pain hypersensitivity, whereas AURKB knockdown reduced microgliosis and alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Accordingly, RNA sequencing data revealed down-regulation of genes critically involved in signaling pathways associated with spinal microgliosis and neuropathic pain after AURKB knockdown in CCI rats. To examine its therapeutic potential for treatment of neuropathic pain, animals were treated intrathecally with the pharmacological AURKB inhibitor AZD1152-HQPA resulting in the alleviation of CCI-induced pain. Taken together, our findings indicated that AURKB plays a critical role in spinal microgliosis and neuropathic pain.

This experiment (N = 68) explored this possibility by requiring individuals with and without MDD to complete a cued-recall task that required retrieval of specific, single-incident memories to a block of cues; retrieval of categoric, general memories to a block of cues; and to alternate between retrieval of specific and general memories for a block of cues. Results demonstrated that relative to never-depressed controls, individuals with MDD experience reduced recall of both specific (d = 0.48) and general memories (d = 1.00) along with reduced flexibility in alternating between specific and general memories (d = 0.90).

In particular, this work focuses on the identification of stable associations between personality on the factor and facet level, fluid intelligence, demography and app usage in 16 distinct categories. A total of 137 subjects (87 women and 50 men), with an average age of 24 (SD = 4.72), participated in a 90?min psychometric lab session as well as in a subsequent 60?day data logging study in the field. Our data suggest that personality traits predict mobile application usage in several specific categories such as communication, photography, gaming, transportation and entertainment. Extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness are better predictors of mobile application usage than basic demographic variables in several distinct categories. Furthermore, predictive performance is slightly higher for single factor?in comparison with facet?level personality scores. Fluid intelligence and demographics additionally show stable associations with categorical app usage. In sum, this study demonstrates how individual differences can be effectively related to actual behaviour and how this can assist in understanding the behavioural underpinnings of personality.

This question is relevant given that many studies suggest that the objective meaning of invisible stimuli can influence cognitive processes and behavior. In an experiment involving 66 participants, we tested how the perceived meaning of misperceived stimuli influenced response times. Stroop priming (i.e., longer response times for incongruent than for congruent prime-target pairs) was observed in trials in which the prime was correctly identified. However, reversed Stroop priming was observed when the prime stimulus was incorrectly identified. Even in trials in which participants reported no perception of the prime and identified the primes at close to chance level (i.e., trials that meet both subjective and objective definitions of being subliminal), Stroop priming corresponded to perceived congruency, not objective congruency. This result suggests that occasional weak percepts and mispercepts are intermixed with no percepts in conditions traditionally claimed to be subliminal, casting doubt on claims of subliminal priming made in previous reports.",2017-03-01,2018-03-20T00:43:32Z,2018-03-20T00:43:47Z,2018-03-20T00:43:32Z,346-355,NA,3,28,NA,Psychol Sci,When Perception Trumps Reality,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VPS22LUQ\Sand and Nilsson - 2017 - When Perception Trumps Reality Perceived, Not Obj.pdf",NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000169

Nowadays such large-scale projects are in fact very difficult to take place, considering environmental, geopolitical, and funding issues. In addition, reprocessing vintage seismic profiles using up-to-date software and tools, it is now possible to further increase their original signal-to-noise ratio. Italian offshore areas have been widely investigated by a dense network of multichannel seismic reflection profiles, acquired by the Italian Authorities in the years 1960, 1970, and 1980 of the last century in the perspective of mineral prospecting. This asset of data has been recovered, reprocessed, and made accessible within a demanding project undertaken by Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS). The present work aims at describing the data recovery and reprocessing methodologies applied to enhance the quality of these vintage multichannel-seismic reflection profiles, and at detailing how to access this huge dataset, that have been made compliant with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and available through the OGS-SNAP data management web portal.

However, despite these powerful new analytic approaches, sample sizes may not always be sufficiently large to deal with the increase in model complexity. This difficult modeling scenario entails large models with a limited number of observations given the number of parameters. Here, we describe a particular strategy to overcome this challenge: regularization, a method of penalizing model complexity during estimation. Regularization has proven to be a viable option for estimating parameters in this small-sample, many-predictors setting, but so far it has been used mostly in linear regression models. We show how to integrate regularization within structural equation models, a popular analytic approach in psychology. We first describe the rationale behind regularization in regression contexts and how it can be extended to regularized structural equation modeling. We then evaluate our approach using a simulation study, showing that regularized structural equation modeling outperforms traditional structural equation modeling in situations with a large number of predictors and a small sample size. Next, we illustrate the power of this approach in two empirical examples: modeling the neural determinants of visual short-term memory and identifying demographic correlates of stress, anxiety, and depression.",2019-03-01,2020-01-14T07:04:59Z,2020-01-14T07:05:10Z,2020-01-14T07:04:59Z,55-76,NA,1,2,NA,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\M26LB7GT\Jacobucci et al. - 2019 - A Practical Guide to Variable Selection in Structu.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,open materials; lasso; MIMIC; regularization; structural equation models; variable selection,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000173

Here, using unbiased lipidomic approaches and direct biochemical assessments, we profiled Land's cycle lipid remodeling in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and temporal-parietal-entorhinal cortices of human amyloid beta precursor protein (ΑβPP) over-expressing mice. We identified a cortex-specific hypo-metabolic signature at symptomatic onset and a cortex-specific hyper-metabolic signature of Land's cycle glycerophosphocholine remodeling over the course of progressive behavioral decline. When N5 TgCRND8 and ΑβPPSwe/PSIdE9 mice first exhibited deficits in the Morris Water Maze, levels of lyso-phosphatidylcholines, LPC(18:0/0:0), LPC(16:0/0:0), LPC(24:6/0:0), LPC(25:6/0:0), the lyso-platelet-activating factor (PAF), LPC(O-18:0/0:0), and the PAF, PC(O-22:6/2:0), declined as a result of reduced calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) activity in all cortices but not hippocampus. Chronic intermittent hypoxia, an environmental risk factor that triggers earlier learning memory impairment in ΑβPPSwe/PSIdE9 mice, elicited these same metabolic changes in younger animals. Thus, this lipidomic signature of phenoconversion appears age-independent. By contrast, in symptomatic N5 TgCRND8 mice, cPLA2α activity progressively increased; overall Lyso-phosphatidylcholines (LPC) and LPC(O) and PC(O-18:1/2:0) levels progressively rose. Enhanced cPLA2α activity was only detected in transgenic mice; however, age-dependent increases in the PAF acetylhydrolase 1b α1 to α2 expression ratio, evident in both transgenic and non-transgenic mice, reduced PAF hydrolysis thereby contributing to PAF accumulation. Taken together, these data identify distinct age-independent and age-dependent disruptions in Land's cycle metabolism linked to symptomatic onset and progressive behavioral decline in animals with pre-existing Αβ pathology.

Instead of in-kind reciprocity—an eye for an eye—negative reciprocity may escalate, taking two eyes for an eye. We tested two competing mechanisms for negative escalation using a modified dictator game that reliably produces escalating reciprocity to others' negative actions but not to positive actions. According to one mechanism, escalation is strategic: a deliberate attempt to deter future harm. According to another mechanism, escalation is reflexive: an impulsive act of retribution without consideration of future consequences. In seven experiments, we find clear evidence consistent with a reflexive mechanism. Encouraging deliberation reduced negative escalation in one-shot interactions as well as in repeated interactions. Focusing on future consequences decreased escalation whereas disabling deliberation increased escalation. Finally, the explicit goal to punish another's negative behavior increased escalation while the goal of deterring future transgressions did not. These experiments suggest that escalation is a reflexive form of punishment rather than a deliberate act of strategic deterrence. Encouraging, enabling, or training deliberative processes may effectively reduce costly escalation in everyday life.",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:44:54Z,2020-02-10T11:47:28Z,2020-02-06T01:44:54Z,103823,NA,NA,84,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Escalation of negative social exchange,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I96DC8BI\Vandermeer et al. - 2019 - Escalation of negative social exchange Reflexive .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C6MMUHG9\S0022103119301350.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000181

Protest attitude uniquely predicts both the political action tendencies of members of disadvantaged groups and willingness to engage in solidarity-based action on behalf of such groups. Furthermore, we find some evidence that protest attitude is able to account for the effects of mobilization messages over a political issue; these messages increase political action tendencies by making attitude towards protest more positive. The results indicate that overall attitude toward protest reflects a wide array of affective, cognitive, and behavioral factors associated with protest that more specific, established predictors of collective political action do not tap.

Specifically, we show that people tend to believe that the future will mirror the present, even when such a belief is unfounded. That is, people overestimate the chances that whatever is happening now, will happen in the future, even when the (known) explicit probabilities of future outcomes contradict such a belief. This appears to be driven by an anchoring and (insufficient) adjustment process, whereby initial beliefs about the future are heavily influenced by the present circumstances, and then subsequent beliefs are not sufficiently adjusted once the probabilities of future outcomes are learned. Across nine studies (employing over 3800 participants), we demonstrate the FIN bias in a variety of forecasting contexts, show that it manifests in incentive compatible settings, and provide evidence in support of an anchoring and (insufficient) adjustment mechanistic account.",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:45:16Z,2020-02-10T11:47:13Z,2020-02-06T01:45:16Z,103830,NA,NA,84,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,The “future is now” bias,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9A7CZPIS\Givi and Galak - 2019 - The “future is now” bias Anchoring and (insuffici.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ICU5E7LG\S0022103119301040.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Forecasting; Prediction; Anchoring and adjustment; Beliefs; Heuristics; Status-quo,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000183

Listeners actively construe the meaning of utterances from both their literal meanings and the pragmatic principles that govern communication. When communicators make pragmatically infelicitous statements, the effects can be similar to paltering—misleading speech that evokes false inferences from true statements. The American Diabetes Association’s (ADA’s) “Diabetes Myths” website provides a real-world case study in such misleading communications. Calling something a myth implies that it is clearly false. Instead, the ADA’s “myths” are false only because of some technicality or uncharitable reading. We compared participants’ baseline knowledge of diabetes with that of participants who read either the ADA’s myths or the myths rewritten as questions that do not presuppose the statement is false. As predicted, exposure to the ADA’s “myths,” but not to the rephrased questions, reduced basic knowledge of diabetes.

We first describe the technique in detail and show how it can be implemented by individual researchers on an experiment by experiment basis. We then use a simulation to explore its success in identifying true parameter values compared to current statistical norms (ANOVAs and GLMMs). We find that posterior passing allows the true effect in the population to be found with greater accuracy and consistency than the other analysis types considered. Furthermore, posterior passing performs almost identically to a data analysis in which all data from all simulated studies are combined and analysed as one dataset. On this basis, we suggest that posterior passing is a viable means of implementing cumulative science. Furthermore, because it prevents the accumulation of large bodies of conflicting literature, it alleviates the need for traditional meta-analyses. Instead, posterior passing cumulatively and collaboratively provides clarity in real time as each new study is produced and is thus a strong candidate for a new, cumulative approach to scientific analyses and publishing.",2019-06-24,2020-01-29T08:00:39Z,2020-01-29T08:00:57Z,2020-01-29T08:00:39Z,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,Cumulative Science via Bayesian Posterior Passing,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"Copyright (c) 2019 Charlotte Olivia Brand, James Patrick Ounsley, Daniel Job van der Post, Thomas Joshua Henry Morgan",NA,NA,NA,open.lnu.se,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6HNG2L4P\Brand et al. - 2019 - Cumulative Science via Bayesian Posterior Passing.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\53W5IRIR\840.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bayesian statistics; replication crisis; metascience; cumulative science; psychological methods; stereotype threat,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000187

If people are naive to this structural feature, then they will tend to have erroneously inflated expectations for the alternatives they choose. In contrast to theories of motivated reasoning, this theory suggests that individuals will overestimate chosen alternatives even before they make their choice. In four studies, we found that students and managers exhibited behavior consistent with naïveté toward this relationship between estimation error and choice, leaving them overoptimistic about their chosen alternatives. This overoptimism from choosing positive error is exacerbated when the true values of the alternatives are close together, when there is more uncertainty about the values of alternatives, and when there are many alternatives to choose from.

Questions about clinical utility, complexity, and difficulty in learning and using the AMPD have been expressed in recent scholarly literature. We examined the learnability, interrater reliability, and clinical utility of the AMPD using a vignette methodology and graduate student raters. Results showed that student clinicians can learn Criterion A of the AMPD to a high level of interrater reliability and agreement with expert ratings. Interrater reliability of the 25 trait facets of the AMPD varied but showed overall acceptable levels of agreement. Examination of severity indexes of PD impairment showed the level of personality functioning (LPF) added information beyond that of global assessment of functioning (GAF).

Results suggest that positive and negative feelings about out-groups may be tied to qualitatively distinct contact experiences.",2019-06-01,2020-01-29T05:59:01Z,2020-01-29T05:59:12Z,2020-01-29T05:59:01Z,917-929,NA,6,30,NA,Psychol Sci,Why Do We Hold Mixed Emotions About Racial Out-Groups?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DBZK4VCK\Barlow et al. - 2019 - Why Do We Hold Mixed Emotions About Racial Out-Gro.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,prejudice; open materials; emotions; intergroup dynamics; racial and ethnic attitudes and relations,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000190

Conclusions of this combined analysis were partly opposite to conclusions reached in previous studies using conventional regression methods.

Consequently, one can infer the type of language a communicator is likely to use to describe in-group and out-group targets. We hypothesized and found evidence for the reverse inference.

In the context of ELF where English is used as a medium of communication among nonnative speakers as well as between native and nonnative speakers, researchers need to examine pragmatic competence based on how L2 learners can navigate communicative demands by using communication strategies skillfully while negotiating their identities. At the same time, it is tenable for teachers to move away from the sole dependence on idealized native-speaker models of appropriateness, politeness, and formality in their pedagogical practice and instead incorporate a nonessentialist viewpoint into formal instruction.

In psychology, the criterion has been p < .05. This criterion has been criticized since its inception, and the criticisms have been rejuvenated with recent failures to replicate studies published in top psychology journals. Several replacement criteria have been suggested including reducing the alpha level to .005 or switching to other types of criteria such as Bayes factors or effect sizes. Here, various decision criteria for statistical significance were evaluated using signal detection analysis on the outcomes of simulated data. The signal detection measure of area under the curve (AUC) is a measure of discriminability with a value of 1 indicating perfect discriminability and 0.5 indicating chance performance. Applied to criteria for statistical significance, it provides an estimate of the decision criterion’s performance in discriminating real effects from null effects. AUCs were high (M = .96, median = .97) for p values, suggesting merit in using p values to discriminate significant effects. AUCs can be used to assess methodological questions such as how much improvement will be gained with increased sample size, how much discriminability will be lost with questionable research practices, and whether it is better to run a single high-powered study or a study plus a replication at lower powers. AUCs were also used to compare performance across p values, Bayes factors, and effect size (Cohen’s d). AUCs were equivalent for p values and Bayes factors and were slightly higher for effect size. Signal detection analysis provides separate measures of discriminability and bias. With respect to bias, the specific thresholds that produced maximally-optimal utility depended on sample size, although this dependency was particularly notable for p values and less so for Bayes factors. The application of signal detection theory to the issue of statistical significance highlights the need to focus on both false alarms and misses, rather than false alarms alone.",2019-03-11,2020-01-29T07:57:58Z,2020-01-29T07:58:18Z,2020-01-29T07:57:58Z,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,Copyright (c) 2019 Jessica K.

In two studies, with 7464 trust decisions from 359 participants and 2723 reciprocity decisions from 221 participants, we find that loss framing increases mean-level trust, but has no effect on mean-level reciprocity. Additionally, loss framing changes how decisions are made: In the domain of losses, trustors and trustees become less calculative — trust decisions involving losses are less sensitive to changes in expected value and reciprocity decisions are less sensitive to the financial temptation to betray trust.

These models also predict that manipulating language exposure can reproduce the experience-related performance differences erroneously attributed to age-related decline in age-matched adults. Consistent with this, results showed that older bilinguals outperformed native speakers in a German PAL test, an advantage that increased with age.

A sample of 97 pairs of stranger participants (N = 194) completed personality measures (Big Five and Triarchic Model of Psychopathy), made personality and social judgments of a photograph of the face of their to-be partner, then engaged in 5 min (maximum) of unstructured interaction with their partner and then made their judgments again. The behaviour of the participants in the interaction was coded using 76 criteria by 13 trained coders. Results showed that, judgments made before and after interaction were correlated, but different. Personality judgment accuracy at Time 1 was poor overall but improved at Time 2 participants for Neuroticism, Extraversion and psychopathic Boldness. Coded behaviours related to ‘engagement’ were those that influenced the person judgments the most, and these were related to Extraversion, Agreeableness and Boldness of participants.

Thirty-one patients with acute facial palsy and 30 healthy controls performed a well-established test battery with tasks both for mere face recognition (FACE) and for recognition of emotional facial expressions (EMO). Participants were tested at disease onset (t1) and about eight weeks thereafter (t2). Recognition accuracy did not differ between groups in FACE and EMO tasks at t1 and t2. By contrast, mean reaction time (RT) in the EMO task was significantly longer for patients than for controls at t1 (10.228 ± 710 ms vs 7.386 ± 283 ms; p = .001), whereas RT in the FACE task did not differ between groups. Parallel to clinical remission, patient's RTs in EMO tasks decreased but remained significantly prolonged at t2. Consistent with theories of embodied cognition, our findings show that facial palsy delays recognition of emotional facial expressions but not face recognition per se. Furthermore, normal accuracy of emotion recognition suggests efficient compensatory mechanisms that preserve this essential social function.

Here, we highlight a potential side effect of these social phenomena: exacerbating economic inequality. In two novel economic games, we manipulated the amount of money with which participants were endowed and then gave them the opportunity to share resources with others. We found that people reciprocated more toward higher-wealth givers, compared with lower-wealth givers, even when those givers were equally generous. Wealthier givers also achieved better reputations than less wealthy ones and therefore received more investments in a social marketplace.

In this paper, we argue that these criticisms exhibit the characteristics of conspiracy theories. We define gender conspiracy beliefs as convictions that gender studies and gender-equality activists represent an ideology secretly designed to harm traditional values and social arrangements. In two studies conducted among Catholics in Poland (Study 1 N= 1019; Study 2 N= 223), we examined the prevalence of gender conspiracy beliefs and their psychological concomitants. We hypothesized that gender conspiracy beliefs should be associated with a defensive identification with one’s religious group, captured by religious collective narcissism. In both studies, Catholic collective narcissism was demonstrated to be a robust predictor of gender conspiracy beliefs. We additionally demonstrated that Catholic collective narcissism predicted outgroup hostility, and this effect was mediated by gender conspiracy beliefs.

Using this novel paradigm to capture 900 observations of targets’ behavior (as trustworthy or untrustworthy), we found that face-based judgments predicted trustworthiness. We also found that this effect was mediated by targets’ expectations of how other people would perceive them and by their intentions to act in accordance with those expectations.

In Study 1, unacquainted participants resolved a dilemma while each represented opposing positions. In Study 2, participants rated their preferences, and after viewing a confederate's preferences, re-rated them in a profile shown to the confederate. In Studies 3 and 4, participants reported their number of lifetime sexual partners in anonymous questionnaires and during a chat (Study 3) or while completing an online profile (Study 4). Results indicated that following sexual priming, participants were more likely to conform to the stranger's views (Studies 1 and 2) and reported fewer sexual partners during actual and potential online interactions than in the questionnaires (Study 3).

However, to date, it is unclear under which specific circumstances these reactions occur. Two experiments were conducted to address this question. In both studies, participants perceived norm-deviant behavior of a group member to subvert the group's identity, which in turn predicted exclusion of the deviate and leaving the group. Group leaving, however, was especially likely when the norm-deviation was perceived to change the group's norm, either due to being accepted (vs. not accepted) by others (Study 1) or due to being shown by a group leader (Study 2). Furthermore, norm-deviations by a leader resulted in a lower social identification with the group, which in turn predicted leaving. These findings suggest that group members leave their group in response to others' norm-deviations only if these deviations induce changes in the group norm and, thereby, reduce the fit between members' self-concepts and the group.",2017-11-01,2018-04-06T00:10:04Z,2018-04-06T00:10:20Z,2018-04-06T00:10:04Z,259-267,NA,NA,73,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QP8BIFUI\Ditrich et al. - 2017 - Time to go!

While several lines of research provide evidence for grounding of action-related conceptual content into sensory-motor systems, results of traditional lesion-deficit studies have been somewhat inconsistent. Further, few studies have directly compared the neural substrates of action and relatively abstract verb comprehension post-stroke. Here, we investigated the impact of the disruption of two neural networks on comprehension of action and relatively abstract verbs in 48 unilateral left-hemisphere stroke patients using two methodologies: 1) lesion-deficit association and 2) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses. Disruption of RSFC between the left inferior frontal gyrus and right hemisphere primary and secondary sensory-motor areas predicted greater relative impairment of action semantics. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed that damage to frontal white matter, extending towards the inferior frontal gyrus, also predicted greater relative impairment of action semantics. On the other hand, damage to the left anterior middle temporal gyrus significantly impaired the more abstract category relative to action. These findings support the view that action and non-action/abstract semantic processing rely on partially dissociable brain networks, with action concepts relying more heavily on sensory-motor areas.

The present study focused on the questions of how stable behavioral tendencies elicited via self-fulfilling prophecies are, and the ease, or difficulty, with which expectancycongruent behavioral tendencies can be reversed. To examine these questions, participants completed varying numbers of computerized reaction time tasks against computer opponents. Participants first played 1, 3, or 5 games against opponents who treated them with hostility, followed by a single game against an opponent who treated them with kindness, and finally played against an opponent who displayed neutral behavior toward them. We predicted that the more times participants played against a hostile opponent, the more difficult it would be for the participants to reduce expectancy-congruent hostile behavior through interaction with an opponent who treated them with kindness. Contrary to our prediction, participants who played the most games against hostile opponents before being exposed to a kind opponent were significantly kinder to the final neutral opponent than were other participants who received less hostile treatment (p = .002).

Whether these commonalities are shaped by potentially universal principles of human information processing has been of central interest in the language and psychological sciences. Research has identified one such abstract property in the domain of word order: Although sentence word-order preferences vary across languages, the superficially different orders result in short grammatical dependencies between words. Because dependencies are easier to process when they are short rather than long, these findings raise the possibility that languages are shaped by biases of human information processing. In the current study, we directly tested the hypothesized causal link. We found that learners exposed to novel miniature artificial languages that had unnecessarily long dependencies did not follow the surface preference of their native language but rather systematically restructured the input to reduce dependency lengths. These results provide direct evidence for a causal link between processing preferences in individual speakers and patterns in linguistic diversity.",2018-01-01,2018-03-19T23:44:31Z,2018-03-19T23:44:43Z,2018-03-19T23:44:31Z,72-82,NA,1,29,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KTEU9J96\Fedzechkina et al. - 2018 - Human Information Processing Shapes Language Chang.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000224

Weather variables consist of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and precipitation disaggregated to an hourly time-step. The only hydrometric variable included in the dataset is stream discharge in a daily time-step. Water chemistry data consisted of total nitrogen (TN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total phosphorus (TP), and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). Samples were collected weekly during the open water season at the same site as the hydrometric gauging station from August 2009 to October 2012 with some gaps (i.e. Fall 2011, Spring 2012, September 2012). In 2013 the sampling frequency was increased to daily or sub-daily during high stream discharge and weekly during low stream discharge. A data overview indicates values within ranges reported for the area. Mean annual, winter, and summer temperatures were 3.5, −10.7, and 17.2°C, respectively. Annual relative humidity averaged 73.1% but was higher and more homogenous in cold seasons. Wind speed was similar over the year with annual average of 4.3 m/s. Solar radiation followed the typical curve reported for western Canada, with peak daily average values around 250 W/m2 in July. Precipitation records were mostly comprised of dry hours with 75.3% of the events being equal or less than 2 mm/h. Stream discharge was typical of the Canadian Prairies; the average peak discharge over the entire period was larger in April (2.3 m3/s) due to large amounts of snowmelt runoff. Average concentrations of TN, TDN, TP, and TDP of 1.54, 1.35, 0.56, and 0.49 mg/L, respectively, were in agreement with values found in previous studies at the site.

Despite lacking conventional meanings, “nonsense” words elicited a high level of consistency in the produced drawings. Meaning attributions made to nonsense words corresponded with meaning attributions made by separate people to drawings that were inspired by the name. Naïve participants were able to recover the name that inspired the drawing with greater-than-chance accuracy.

Across three replicated experiments, we demonstrated that native English speakers are more likely to interpret implausible utterances, such as “the mother gave the candle the daughter,” as similar plausible utterances (“the mother gave the candle to the daughter”) when the speaker has a foreign accent.

Research in adults has begun to elucidate the psychological mechanisms and neural substrates underlying these learning processes and factors that influence their relative recruitment. However, the developmental trajectory of these evaluative strategies has not been well characterized. In this study, children, adolescents, and adults performed a sequential reinforcement-learning task that enabled estimation of model-based and model-free contributions to choice. Whereas a model-free strategy was apparent in choice behavior across all age groups, a model-based strategy was absent in children, became evident in adolescents, and strengthened in adults.

When individuals highly value their interpersonal relationships with others, they may take the potential costs to relationships into consideration in deciding how to handle conflict. We propose that individuals take an avoidance approach to conflict to prevent disruption in relationships from confrontation. Specifically, the value that individuals place on superficial harmony is positively related to their negative anticipation of relationship costs, which in turn leads to conflict avoidance. Furthermore, the direct relationship between superficial harmony and negative anticipation and the indirect relationship between superficial harmony and conflict avoidance are negatively moderated by the closeness of relations between the parties involved. The results of two studies conducted in workplace settings supported our hypothesized moderated mediation model. Highlighting the role of superficial harmony in conflict avoidance, this research contributes to the existing literature on conflict management and has practical implications for effectively managing conflict in the workplace. ,  摘要: 本研究关注人们在工作场合中如何对潜在的冲突进行感知和反应。如果人们非常重视自己与他人之间的关系, 会在决定如何处理冲突时考虑该处理方式的关系成本。我们认为, 人们之所以回避冲突, 是因为他们想保护关系不被直面冲突所破坏。具体而言, 个人的表面和谐价值观与其对关系成本的负面预期正相关, 进而导致其回避冲突。不仅如此, 表面和谐与负面预期之间的关系、表面和谐与冲突回避之间的间接关系, 都受到冲突双方的关系亲密度的负向调节作用。我们在工作场景中开展了两个研究, 结果支持了我们假设的受到调节作用的中介模型。本研究揭示了表面和谐的价值观对于冲突回避的影响, 对冲突管理的文献有所贡献, 并对如何有效管理工作场合中的冲突提供了实践启示。 ,  यह शोध यह अध्ययन करता है की किस प्रकार लोग प्रत्याशित संघर्ष को अनुभूत करते हैं व उस पर प्रतिक्रिया देते हैं. जब लोग अपने अंतर्वैयक्तिक संबंधों को अधिक महत्व देते हैं तो वे अपने संघर्ष प्रतिक्रिया सम्बन्धी निर्णयों में उसको संबंधों पर संभावित मूल्य का लिहाज़ करते हैं. हमारा यह मत है की लोग मुकाबले से संबंधों में खलल रोकने के लिए संघर्ष वर्जन का दृष्टिकोण लेते हैं. विशेषतः लोगों द्वारा सतही समन्वय को दिया गया महत्व सम्बन्ध-मूल्य की नकारात्मक प्रत्याशा से सीधा सम्बन्ध रखता है जिसका परिणाम संघर्ष वर्जन होता है. साथ ही में सतही समन्वय व नकारात्मक प्रत्याशा के सीधे सम्बन्ध तथा सतही समन्वय व संघर्ष वर्जन के परोक्ष सम्बन्ध पर पक्षों की घनिष्ठता नकारात्मक संयमन दिखती है. दो कार्यस्थलों में किये गए हमारे अध्ययन के परिणाम हमारे अनुमानित संयमित मध्यस्थ आदर्श को समर्थन देते हैं. संघर्ष वर्जन में सतही समन्वय की विशिष्टता को उजागर करते हुए यह शोध पत्र संघर्ष प्रबंधन के सम्प्रति शोध साहित्य में योगदान करता है. इस शोध पत्र के कार्यस्थल में संघर्ष के प्रभावी प्रबंधन के लिए व्यावहारिक आशय हैं. ,  Sumário: Esta pesquisa examina como as pessoas percebem e respondem a conflitos potenciais em ambientes de trabalho. Quando os indivíduos valorizam suas relações interpessoais com outros, eles podem levar em consideração os custos potenciais aos relacionamentos ao decidir como lidar com conflitos. Nós propomos que indivíduos adotam uma abordagem de evitar o conflito para impedir a ruptura em relacionamentos devido ao confronto. Especificamente, o valor que os indivíduos dedicam à harmonia superficial está positivamente relacionado com sua antecipação negativa de custos de relacionamento, o que, por sua vez, leva a evitar conflitos. Além disso, a relação direta entre harmonia superficial e antecipação negativa e a relação indireta entre harmonia superficial e evasão de conflitos são negativamente moderadas pela proximidade das relações entre as partes envolvidas. Os resultados de dois estudos realizados em ambientes de trabalho apoiaram o modelo de mediação moderada hipotetizado. Ao destacar o papel da harmonia superficial na evasão de conflitos, esta pesquisa contribui para a literatura existente sobre o gerenciamento de conflitos e tem implicações práticas para o efetivo gerenciamento de conflitos no local de trabalho. ,  Аннотация: В данной работе исследуется, как люди воспринимают и реагируют на потенциальные конфликты на рабочем месте. В процессе принятия решений об урегулировании конфликтов, люди могут принимать во внимание потенциальный ущерб отношениям в том случае, если они высоко ценят межличностные отношения. Мы предполагаем, что люди избегают конфликтов, чтобы не допустить разрушения отношений из-за конфронтации. В частности, существует прямая зависимость между ценностью внешней гармонии и негативными ожиданиями ущерба для отношений, что в свою очередь способствует предотвращению конфликтов. Кроме того, прямая зависимость между внешней гармонией и негативными ожиданиями, а также косвенная зависимость между внешней гармонией и предотвращением конфликтов, обратно пропорциональны близости отношений между заинтересованными сторонами. Результаты двух исследований, проведенных на рабочих местах, подтвердили нашу гипотетическую модель модерируемого посредничества. Подчеркивая роль внешней гармонии в предотвращении конфликтов, это исследование вносит важный вклад в существующую литературу по вопросам урегулирования конфликтов, а также делает практические выводы о том, как эффективно предотвращать конфликты на рабочем месте. ,  Resumen: Esta investigación examina como las personas perciben y responden a conflictos potenciales en los entornos laborales. Cuando los individuos valoran mucho sus relaciones interpersonales con otros, pueden tener en cuenta los costos potenciales de las relaciones al decidir cómo manejar el conflicto. Proponemos que los individuos adoptan una perspectiva de evitación al conflicto para prevenir disrupciones en las relaciones a partir de confrontación. Específicamente, el valor que los individuos le dan a la armonía superficial se relaciona positivamente con su anticipación negativa de los costos de la relación, la cual a cambio lleva a la evitación de conflictos.

In the laboratory, however, joint attention is often investigated using computerized gaze cueing tasks that do not allow shared gaze. Instead, these computerized tasks require the participant to maintain fixation on the virtual partner's face, while the partner gazes to the left or right. Here we designed a modified gaze cueing task that better simulates a natural joint attention episode by allowing shared gaze, while still maintaining tight experimental control. In our computerized task the participant's gaze and the gaze of a virtual partner were manipulated independently, resulting in shared or unshared gaze. Following each gaze shift of the virtual partner a touch stimulus was delivered on one of the cheeks of the participant. We analyzed behavioral and neural (electro-encephalography) responses to the touch. Faster reaction-times and stronger lateralization of alpha power were observed when the touched cheek was in a jointly attended hemispace compared with a singly attended or unattended hemispace. Importantly, these effects were unique to joint attention and could not be explained as the additive effects of own gaze and gaze cue direction. Underlining its social nature, we found that the behavioral effect was absent when we repeated our experiment with nonsocial cues (arrows) instead of gaze cues. Furthermore, when we compared trustworthy with untrustworthy virtual partners (trustworthiness judgements based on facial appearance) we found the effect only for trustworthy and not for untrustworthy virtual partners. We conclude that joint attention based on shared gaze influences attentional orienting such that cross-modal sensory processing at the jointly attended location is facilitated, particularly when the partner is trustworthy. This indicates that social interactions and trustworthiness judgements affect cortical and behavioral responses to sensory information.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:35:21Z,2020-01-30T07:39:39Z,2020-01-30T07:35:21Z,1-11,NA,NA,119,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\W8YINA9V\de Jong and Dijkerman - 2019 - The influence of joint attention and partner trust.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BBWJGQQA\S0010945219301649.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Alpha oscillations; Gaze following; Joint attention; Trustworthiness; Visuo-tactile cueing,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000234

In Studies 1–6, participants were less likely to adjust beyond a particular amount when that amount was closer to the maximum allowable adjustment. For example, in Study 5, participants were less likely to adjust by at least 6 units when they were allowed to adjust by a maximum of 6 units than by a maximum of 15 units.

A network model of psychopathology assumes that observable features of disorders directly interact, and network analytic methods quantify how central each feature is. We conducted a network analysis of core deficits of BPD features using a large (N = 4,386) sample of participants with a range of BPD features. The most central features of participants in the High BPD group were loneliness, recklessness/impulsivity, and intense moods, supporting models of emotion dysregulation and interpersonal problems.

We test the relationship between representation and legitimacy beliefs through survey experiments on a nationally representative sample of U.S. citizens. First, we find that women's equal presence legitimizes decisions that go against women's interests. We show suggestive evidence that this effect is particularly pronounced among men, who tend to hold less certain views on women's rights. Second, across decision outcomes and issue areas, women's equal presence legitimizes decision-making processes and confers institutional trust and acquiescence.

This hypothesis assumes discrete perception. In particular, the amplitude and the phase of the low frequency rhythm entails a cortical mechanism which paces the access of sensory information into the cognitive system. Evidence supporting this idea includes correlations between the phase of neural oscillations and behavioral performance in perception, spatial attention and working memory. Despite a widespread confidence in the theory, these findings have been mostly based on a varied range of exploratory approaches and inferential group statistics. Here, we aimed at validating the involvement of low frequency cortical rhythm in perception and at providing a clear-cut EEG analysis pipeline. Such an analytical pipeline should support the adoption of a hypothesis-driven framework for future replications and applications.

Here, we used a public-goods game with punishment to test whether antisocial punishment is used as a means of competing to be chosen by suppressing others’ cooperation. As predicted, there was more antisocial punishment when participants were competing to be chosen for a subsequent cooperative task (a trust game) than without a subsequent task.

Although many studies have investigated how nearby objects influence perception in cluttered scenes (i.e., crowding), none has studied how nearby objects influence visually guided action. In Experiment 1, we found that participants could scale their grasp to the size of a crowded target even when they could not perceive its size, demonstrating for the first time that neurologically intact participants can use visual information that is not available to conscious report to scale their grasp to real objects in real scenes. In Experiments 2 and 3, we found that changing the eccentricity of the display and the orientation of the flankers had no effect on grasping but strongly affected perception. The differential effects of eccentricity and flanker orientation on perception and grasping show that the known differences in retinotopy between the ventral and dorsal streams are reflected in the way in which people deal with targets in cluttered scenes.",2015-01-01,2018-03-20T23:55:51Z,2018-03-20T23:55:59Z,2018-03-20T23:55:51Z,58-69,NA,1,26,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\P953I34L\Chen et al. - 2015 - Differences in the Effects of Crowding on Size Per.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000245

Effects of non-sphericity in the population on Type I error were also inspected: 5,000 random samples were drawn from two populations containing neither a within-subject nor a between-group effect. They were analyzed including the most common options to correct rANOVA and MLM-results: The Huynh-Feldt-correction for rANOVA (rANOVA-HF) and the Kenward-Roger-correction for MLM (MLM-KR), which could help to correct progressive bias of MLM with an unstructured covariance matrix (MLM-UN). Moreover, uncorrected rANOVA and MLM assuming a compound symmetry covariance structure (MLM-CS) were also taken into account. The results showed a progressive bias for MLM-UN for small samples which was stronger in SPSS than in SAS. Moreover, an appropriate bias correction for Type I error via rANOVA-HF and an insufficient correction by MLM-UN-KR for n < 30 were found. These findings suggest MLM-CS or rANOVA if sphericity holds and a correction of a violation via rANOVA-HF.

However, agents may not be consistent when facing the same decision several times. In this paper, Shannon's entropy (H) is employed as a measure of behavioral inconsistency: it is a central measure of information theory that, applied to decision making, allows the estimation of behavioral preferences among a set of options. We scanned (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) 24 young (18–25 year) subjects (14 female) while performing a decision-making task, where monetary rewards were devalued by physical effort (minutes running in the treadmill) and risk. Twenty different pairs of options were presented nine times each, and H was calculated for each pair and subject. Behavioral analyses showed that subjective value (SV) significantly explained agents' preferences only in pairs with a low inconsistent response. Averaged response time positively correlated with H, confirming entropy as an indicator of choice difficulty. Group analyses on fMRI data revealed a cluster in the paracingulate cortex as the neural correlate of H. Besides, BOLD signal in the posterior cingulate correlated with the SV of the pair only in consistent decisions, confirming that SV loses its explanatory power on highly inconsistent decisions. Finally, the anterior and central cingulate were especially recruited when predicting a secured effortless reward, compared with a secured reward that involved a maximum effort. Our study shows that different regions of the cingulate cortex are involved in choice inconsistency, SV and processing effort costs.",2019-04-01,2020-01-30T06:50:49Z,2020-01-30T06:51:09Z,2020-01-30T06:50:49Z,96-110,NA,NA,113,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BGK442U2\Bernacer et al. - 2019 - Neural correlates of effort-based behavioral incon.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DAMNCYC4\S0010945218304143.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Choice difficulty; Cingulate cortex; Discounting; Physical effort; Shannon's entropy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000248

Acting as a protein interaction hub, ARC regulates diverse signalling events in postsynaptic neurons. A protein interaction site is present in the ARC C-terminal domain (CTD), a bilobar structure homologous to the retroviral Gag capsid domain. We hypothesized that detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional molecular structure of monomeric full-length ARC is crucial to understand its function; therefore, we set out to determine the structure of ARC to understand its various functional modalities. We purified recombinant ARC and analyzed its structure using small-angle X-ray scattering and synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy. Monomeric full-length ARC has a compact, closed structure, in which the oppositely charged N-terminal domain (NTD) and CTD are juxtaposed, and the flexible linker between them is not extended. The modeled structure of ARC is supported by intramolecular live-cell Förster resonance energy transfer imaging in rat hippocampal slices. Peptides from several postsynaptic proteins, including stargazin, bind to the N-lobe, but not to the C-lobe, of the bilobar CTD. This interaction does not induce large-scale conformational changes in the CTD or flanking unfolded regions. The ARC NTD contains long helices, predicted to form an anti-parallel coiled coil; binding of ARC to phospholipid membranes requires the NTD. Our data support a role for the ARC NTD in oligomerization as well as lipid membrane binding. The findings have important implications for the structural organization of ARC with respect to distinct functions, such as postsynaptic signal transduction and virus-like capsid formation.

In two studies, people chose between pairs of options: one with a single, sure delay and the other involving multiple, probabilistic delays (a lottery). The probability of each delay occurring either was explicitly described (timing risk) or could be learned through experiential sampling (timing uncertainty; the delay itself was not experienced). When the shorter delay was rare, people preferred the lottery more often when it was described than when it was experienced. When the longer delay was rare, this pattern was reversed. Modeling analyses suggested that underexperiencing rare delays and different patterns of probability weighting contribute to this description–experience gap.

Sixty-nine English-speaking learners of L2 French undertook either: (a) a ‘core’ treatment of EI about the L2 with L2 comprehension practice, (b) the same L2 core + L1 comprehension practice, (c) the same L2 core + L1 comprehension practice + EI about L1, or (d) outcome tests only. Results showed that providing additional EI about the L1 benefitted the accuracy of oral production immediately after the instruction and then 6 weeks later.

We hypothesized that representing the associations using personality questionnaire items (as markers for personality nuances) could increase prediction strength. Using the National Child Development Study (N = 8719), we predicted 40 diverse outcomes from both the Big Five domains and their 50 items. Models were trained (using penalized regression) and applied for prediction in independent sample partitions (with 100 permutations). Item models tended to out-predict Big Five models (explaining on average 30% more variance), regardless of outcomes' independently rated breadth versus behavioural specificity. Moreover, the predictive power of Big Five domains per se was at least partly inflated by the unique variance of their constituent items, especially for generally more predictable outcomes. Removing the Big Five variance from items marginally reduced their predictive power. These findings are consistent with the possibility that the associations of personality with outcomes often pertain to (potentially large numbers of) specific behavioural, cognitive, affective, and motivational characteristics represented by single questionnaire items rather than to the broader (underlying) traits that these items are ostensibly indicators of. This may also have implications for personality-based interventions.

A largely unanswered question concerns the extent to which self-control changes across the lifespan and in response to major life events. The present research used prospective four-wave data from 539 Dutch individuals to examine the self-control trajectory of first-time parents (n = 246) as compared with individuals who did not have children during the research period (n = 293). New parents (especially mothers) reported higher levels of self-control before birth (i.e. during pregnancy) than did nonparents. New mothers showed significant non-linear decreases in self-control, which were especially strong from pregnancy until 6 months after childbirth. New fathers' self-control remained largely stable. Furthermore, pregnancy-related stress was associated with lower self-control levels during pregnancy in both first-time mothers and fathers.

Increased expectations of a positive taste experience mediated the effect of taste-focused labels on vegetable selection. Moderation tests revealed greater effects in settings that served tastier vegetable recipes.

The VWFA and FFA have clear but opposite population-level asymmetries, with the VWFA typically being lateralized to the left and the FFA to the right hemisphere. The present study investigates how language dominance may relate to these asymmetries. We hypothesize that individuals with left hemisphere dominance for word production (i.e., left language dominance, LLD) will have typical lateralization for word and face recognition in the fusiform gyrus, whereas participants with right language dominance (RLD) will demonstrate ‘atypical’ rightward laterality for words and leftward dominance for faces. To test this hypothesis, we recruited twenty-seven left-handers who had previously been identified as being LLD or RLD based on a visual half field task. Using fMRI, hemisphere dominance was determined for language (Broca's region) as well as for word and face recognition in the middle fusiform gyrus for each participant. The direction of asymmetry correlated significantly between language and recognizing words (ρ = .648, p < .001) as well as between language and face recognition (ρ = −.620, p = .001). Moreover, most LLD-participants were typically lateralized for faces and written words, while both functions tended to be reversed in individuals with RLD. However, segregation between language and face recognition was less clear in participants with RLD, as many of them lacked an obvious asymmetry for faces. Although our results thus suggest there is no one-on-one relationship between asymmetries for language, written word and face recognition, they also argue against a complete independence of their lateralization.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:16:43Z,2020-01-30T07:17:04Z,2020-01-30T07:16:43Z,196-204,NA,NA,117,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\W8YZFFML\Gerrits et al. - 2019 - Laterality for recognizing written words and faces.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GRTJH3TJ\S0010945219301224.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Brain asymmetry; Face recognition; Language dominance; Lateralization; Reading,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000257

Results revealed that interactions that were social (vs. task-oriented) and with close (vs. less close) others were associated with higher momentary happiness as were higher levels of the target person's extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and lower neuroticism. Of the 10 personality × situation interactions tested, only one reached significance (with p = .041): Individuals with higher levels of neuroticism benefitted more from interactions with friends than did individuals low in neuroticism. The role of social context characteristics for momentary happiness changed with age, but the role of personality or personality × social context did not, suggesting that personality effects on happiness in social context manifest in similar ways across the adult lifespan.

Available therapies are based only on anticoagulants or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Extracellular adenosine increases during ischemia and acts as a neuroprotective endogenous agent mainly by activating adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs) which control calcium influx, glutamate release, membrane potential, and metabolism. Accordingly, in many experimental paradigms it has been already demonstrated that the stimulation of A1R with full agonists is able to reduce ischemia-related structural and functional brain damage; unfortunately, cardiovascular side effects and desensitization of A1R induced by these compounds have strongly limited their exploitation in stroke therapy so far. Among the newly emerging compounds, A1R partial agonists could be almost free of side effects and equally effective. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of two A1R partial agonists, namely 2′-dCCPA and 3′-dCCPA, in in vitro and ex vivo experimental models of cerebral ischemia. Within the experimental paradigm of oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells both A1R partial agonists increased cell viability. Considering the high level of expression of A1Rs in the hippocampus and the susceptibility of CA1 region to hypoxia, we performed electrophysiological experiments in this subfield. The application of 7 min of oxygen-glucose deprivation constantly produces an irreversible synaptic failure in all the C57Bl/6 mice hippocampal slices evaluated; both tested compounds allowed a significant recovery of synaptic transmission. These findings demonstrate that A1R and its partial agonists are still of interest for cerebral ischemia therapy.

As new legislators enter the assembly, the connections and knowledge of former members expire and lose value.

We argue that the spatial scale of competition—the extent to which individuals compete locally, with their interaction partners, or globally, with the entire population—can help settle the question. We built a mathematical model of the evolution of conflict under inequality and tested its predictions in an experimental game with 1,205 participants. We found that inequality increases conflict, destroys wealth, and engenders risk taking. Crucially, these effects are amplified by local competition. Thus, inequality is at its most damaging when it arises between close competitors. Indeed, at the extremes, the combined effects of inequality and the scale of competition are very large.

This study is a conceptual replication and extension of Sonbul and Schmitt's research. Sixty-two advanced English as a second language (ESL) speakers read texts containing repeated occurrences of low-frequency medical collocations in three sessions over 2 days. The incidental learning treatments included reading only (no typographic enhancement), bolding, and bolding-plus-glossing. Collocational knowledge was assessed in tests of explicit knowledge (cued recall, form recognition) and a test of implicit knowledge (primed lexical decision). Repeated exposure to bolded collocations produced greater explicit knowledge than repeated exposure to typographically unenhanced collocations. Evidence of implicit knowledge development was observed in the unenhanced (reading only) treatment but not in the remaining treatments.

We collected data from 616 Flemish children between 10 and 12 years old by using a questionnaire about learners’ extramural English, an English vocabulary test, and a Dutch vocabulary test. The findings revealed that participating learners frequently engaged in activities involving English before receiving formal instruction and that their amount of extramural English increased with age. The results also showed the rate of vocabulary growth from exposure to extramural English for three contiguous age groups. Further, both word-related and learner-related variables predicted vocabulary knowledge. Cognateness was the most powerful predictor, followed by frequency and concreteness.

In the hermaphrodite marine mollusk, Aplysia californica, truncated forms of protein kinase C (PKC) termed protein kinase Ms have been implicated in both intermediate- and long-term facilitation, an increase in synaptic strength between sensory neurons and motor neurons thought to underlie behavioural sensitization in the animal. However, few substrates have been identified as candidates that could mediate this increase in synaptic strength. PKMs have been proposed to maintain synaptic strength through preventing endocytosis of AMPA receptors. Numb is a conserved regulator of endocytosis that is modulated by phosphorylation. We have identified and cloned Aplysia Numb (ApNumb). ApNumb contains three conserved PKC phosphorylation sites and PKMs generated from classical and atypical Aplysia PKCs can phosphorylate ApNumb in vitro and in cells. Over-expression of ApNumb that lacks the conserved PKC phosphorylation sites blocks increases in surface levels of a pHluorin-tagged Aplysia glutamate receptor measured using live imaging after intermediate- or long-term facilitation. Over-expression of this form of ApNumb did not block increases in synaptic strength seen during intermediate-term facilitation, but did block increases in synaptic strength seen during long-term facilitation. There was no effect of over-expression of this form of ApNumb on other putative Numb targets as measured using increases in calcium downstream of neurotrophins or agonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors. These results suggest that in Aplysia neurons, Numb specifically regulates AMPA receptor trafficking and is an attractive candidate for a target of PKMs in long-term maintenance of synaptic strength.

Because an agent's state of mind is not directly observable, people typically engage in mindreading—attempts at inferring mental states—when forming moral evaluations. The present paper identifies a general target of such mental state inference, mental occurrents—a catchall term for the thoughts, beliefs, principles, feelings, concerns, and rules accessible in an agent's mind when confronting a morally relevant decision. Moral mental occurrents are those that can provide a moral justification for a particular course of action. Whereas previous mindreading research has examined how people reason back to make sense of an agent's behavior, we instead ask how inferred moral mental occurrents (MOs) constrain moral evaluations for an agent's subsequent actions. Our studies distinguish three accounts of how inferred MOs influence moral evaluations, show that people rely on inferred MOs spontaneously (instead of merely when experimental measures draw attention to them), and identify non-moral contextual cues (e.g., whether the situation demands a quick decision) that guide inferences about MOs. Implications for theory of mind, moral psychology, and social cognition are discussed.",2020-03-01,2020-02-06T01:28:57Z,2020-02-10T11:50:53Z,2020-02-06T01:28:57Z,103906,NA,NA,87,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Moral character evaluation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S7WB8UVA\Critcher et al. - 2020 - Moral character evaluation Testing another's mora.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YIX7RLC3\S0022103118306978.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Person perception; Theory of mind; Mental state inference; Mental occurrents; Moral evaluation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000278

Importantly, this congruency effect is diminished when the trials in an experiment are mostly incongruent, relative to mostly congruent, termed a proportion congruent effect. When distracting stimuli are mostly congruent in one context (e.g., location or font) but mostly incongruent in another context (e.g., another location or font), the congruency effect is still diminished in the mostly incongruent context, termed a context-specific proportion congruent (CSPC) effect. Both the standard proportion congruent and CSPC effects are typically interpreted in terms of conflict-driven attentional control, frequently termed conflict adaptation or conflict monitoring. However, in two experiments, we investigated contingency learning confounds in context-specific proportion congruent effects. In particular, two variants of a dissociation procedure are presented with the font variant of the CSPC procedure. In both, robust contingency learning effects were observed.

Twenty-three neurotypical adults and 19 individuals with aphasia served as participants. Aphasic individuals were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week course of linguistically-based treatment of passive sentence production and comprehension (N = 14, treatment group) or to serve as control participants (N = 5, natural history group). Both aphasic groups performed two offline tasks at baseline and three months following (at post-testing) to assess production and comprehension of trained passive structures and untrained syntactically related and unrelated structures. The aphasic participants and a healthy age-matched group also performed an online eyetracking comprehension task and a picture-verification fMRI task, which were repeated at post-testing for the aphasic groups. Results showed that individuals in the treatment, but not in the natural history, group improved on production and comprehension of both trained structures and untrained syntactically related structures. Treatment also resulted in a shift toward more normal-like eye movements and a significant increase in neural activation from baseline to post-testing. Upregulation encompassed right hemisphere regions homologs of left hemisphere regions involved in both sentence processing and domain-general functions and was positively correlated with treatment gains, as measured by offline comprehension accuracy, and with changes in processing strategies during sentence comprehension, as measured by eyetracking. These findings provide compelling evidence in favor of the contribution of both networks within the right hemisphere to the restoration of normal-like sentence processing patterns in chronic aphasia.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:54:25Z,2020-01-30T11:12:14Z,2020-01-30T07:54:23Z,394-418,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,Recovery of offline and online sentence processing in aphasia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UXWHGESD\Barbieri et al. - 2019 - Recovery of offline and online sentence processing.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UITP5GUT\S001094521930259X.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,fMRI; Sentence comprehension; Aphasia; Eyetracking; Online sentence processing; Treatment of underlying forms,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000283

Accordingly, we investigated the extent to which framing the very same information as either advice or anchor exerts a differential influence on quantitative judgments. Four experiments showed that although arbitrary anchors were given lower weight than advice, they nevertheless exerted a systematic impact on final judgments. Degree of integration was related to subjective confidence only in the advice condition, but not in the anchoring condition, suggesting that arbitrary anchors were not considered informative. Framing the source of advice as a human being versus as a computer did not affect our results. Only the aboutness of advice, that is, whether it targeted the focal judgment item, determined its influence on final judgments and on confidence. On the one hand, these findings speak to the (partial) sensitivity of human judges to the source and validity of advice under uncertainty. On the other hand, the persevering effect of arbitrary anchors demonstrates the dependence of judgments on unauthorized influences.

Subroutines underlying cell death after stroke are largely unknown despite their importance in the design of novel therapies for this pathology. Necroptosis, a recently described form of regulated cell death, has been related with inflammation and, in some models, with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We hypothesize that alleviation of ER stress following a salubrinal treatment will reduce the ischemic-dependent necroptosis. To probe the hypothesis, we measured, at 48 and 72 h after transient global cerebral ischemia in rat, in cerebral cortex and cornu ammonis 1, the main hallmarks of necroptosis: mRNA levels and phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase as well as receptor interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3, along the years 2017–2018. Selective neuronal loss after 7 days of the ischemic insult, and other markers related with the inflammatory response were also measured. This study shows that necroptosis in cerebral cortex can be detected after 72 h of the insult and seems to be elicited before 48 h of reperfusion. The type of necroptosis here observed seems to be tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 independent. Necroptotic response is less evident in the cornu ammonis 1 hippocampal area than in cerebral cortex. The treatment with salubrinal administered 1 and 24 h after the ischemia, decreased the necroptotic marker levels and reduced the areas of selective neuronal loss, supporting the presence of ischemic-dependent necroptosis, and the notion that ER stress is involved in the necroptotic response.

Prior research has generally explained such preference mismatches as decision makers mispredicting recipients’ satisfaction. We proposed that a “smile-seeking” motive is a distinct cause for these mismatches in the context of gift giving. After examining common gift options for which gift givers expect a difference between the recipients’ affective reaction (e.g., a smile when receiving the gift) and overall satisfaction, we found that givers often chose to forgo satisfaction-maximizing gifts and instead favor reaction-maximizing gifts. This reaction-maximizing preference was mitigated when givers anticipated not giving the gift in person. Results from six studies suggest that anticipated affective reactions powerfully shape gift givers’ choices and giving experiences, independently of (and even in spite of) anticipated recipient satisfaction. These findings reveal a dominant yet overlooked role that the display of affective reactions plays in motivating and rewarding gift-giving behaviors and shed new light on interpersonal decision making.",2018-08,2019-04-06T18:17:46Z,2019-04-06T18:17:57Z,2019-04-06T18:17:46Z,1221-1233,NA,8,29,NA,NA,The Smile-Seeking Hypothesis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EDS8QR2R\Yang en Urminsky - 2018 - The Smile-Seeking Hypothesis How Immediate Affect.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000287

Here, using a divided-attention method based on the dot-probe technique, we showed that attentional selection toward values congruent with the task goal takes place while participants make choices between alternatives that consist of payoff sequences.

The results show that prediction task performance indeed influences general self-efficacy, and neither of these two moderators has a significant effect on this relationship.

To better understand replication practice, we first provide a narrative review of challenges related to replication, drawing on recent developments in psychology. This discussion frames and motivates a systematic review, building on syntheses of replication in psychology, education, and L2 research. We coded 67 self-labeled L2 replication studies found across 26 journals for 136 characteristics. We estimated a mean rate of 1 published replication study for every 400 articles, with a mean of 6.64 years between initial and replication studies and a mean of 117 citations of the initial study before a replication was published. Replication studies had an annual mean of 7.3 citations, much higher than averages in linguistics and education. Overlap in authorship between initial and replication studies and the availability of the initial materials both increased the likelihood of a replication supporting the initial findings. Our sample contained no direct (exact) replication attempts, and changes made to initial studies were numerous and wide ranging, which likely obscured, if not undermined, the interpretability of replication studies. To improve the amount and quality of L2 replication research, we propose 16 recommendations relating to rationale, nomenclature, design, infrastructure, and incentivization for collaboration and publication.

Human infants are relatively altricial and need their parents’ attention to survive. Infant-directed song may constitute a signal of that attention. In Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare disorder of genomic imprinting, genes from chromosome 15q11–q13 that are typically paternally expressed are unexpressed, which results in exaggeration of traits that reduce offspring’s investment demands on the mother. PWS may thus be associated with a distinctive musical phenotype. We report unusual responses to music in people with PWS. Subjects with PWS (N = 39) moved more during music listening, exhibited greater reductions in heart rate in response to music listening, and displayed a specific deficit in pitch-discrimination ability relative to typically developing adults and children (N = 589). Paternally expressed genes from 15q11–q13, which are unexpressed in PWS, may thus increase demands for music and enhance perceptual sensitivity to music.

Most neuropsychological studies of attention deficits after pulvinar lesion have concerned single patients or small samples. Here we examined a group of 13 patients with focal damage to posterior thalamus on a visual search task with faces, allowing us to test several hypotheses concerning pulvinar function in controlling attention to visually salient or emotionally significant stimuli. Our results identified two subgroups of thalamic patients with distinct patterns of attentional responsiveness to emotional and colour features in face targets. One group with lesions located in anterior and ventral portions of thalamus showed intact performance, with a normal facilitation of visual search for faces with emotional (fearful or happy) expressions on both side of space, similar to healthy controls. By contrast, a second group showed a slower and poorer detection of face targets, most severe for neutral faces, but with a paradoxically enhanced facilitation by both colour and emotional features.

For example, when astronomers used the “eye and ear” method to locate stars, they showed systematic interindividual errors. In the current study, we showed that temporal-order perception may be considered a psychological bias that attention can modulate but not fully eradicate. According to Titchener’s law of prior entry, attention prioritizes the perception of an event and thus can help compensate for possible interindividual differences in the perceived timing of an event by normalizing perception in time. In a longitudinal study, we tested the stability of participants’ temporal-order perception across and within sensory modalities, together with the magnitude of the participants’ prior-entry effect. All measurements showed the persistence of stable interindividual variability. Crucially, the magnitude of the prior-entry effect was insufficient to compensate for interindividual variability: Conscious time order was systematically subjective, and therefore traceable on an individual basis.",2017-05-01,2018-03-20T00:37:04Z,2018-03-20T00:37:15Z,2018-03-20T00:37:01Z,670-678,NA,5,28,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\EYRHD538\Grabot and Wassenhove - 2017 - Time Order as Psychological Bias.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000301

Information necessary to form preferences on the deficit is not provided neutrally, and its provision shapes how voters understand their interests. A wide range of evidence from Britain between 2010 and 2015 supports this claim. In the British Election Study, deficit attitudes vary systematically with the source of news consumption, even controlling for party identification. A structural topic model of two major newspapers' reporting shows that content varies systematically with respect to coverage of public borrowing—in ways that intuitively accord with the attitudes of their readership.

We used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate left parietal areas and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure object-related neural responses in the ventral stream. We find that representational geometries and category discriminability within ventral temporal cortex, as well as functional connectivity between ventral temporal and parietal areas, are enhanced by anodal compared to cathodal stimulation of left parietal associative cortex.

Using performance-based tasks, we show that triggering events, in which B moves noticeably faster than A, are treated as being categorically different from launching events, in which B does not move noticeably faster than A, and that these categories are unique to causal events (Experiments 1 and 2).

However, there is variability across subjects in the extent to which stimulation modulates behaviour, providing a challenge for the development of applications. Here, we employed an individual differences approach to test if baseline concentrations of the neurochemicals GABA and glutamate are associated with an individual's response to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Using a previously replicated response selection training paradigm, we applied tDCS to the left prefrontal cortex part-way through the learning of a six-alternative-forced-choice task. Across three sessions, subjects received anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation. Pre-tDCS baseline measures of GABA and glutamate, acquired using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), correlated with the extent to which stimulation modulated behaviour. Specifically, relative concentrations of GABA and glutamate (used as an index of neurochemical excitability) in the prefrontal cortex were associated with the degree to which active stimulation disrupted response selection training.

We conducted network analyses for AN and comorbid depression and anxiety using longitudinal data (N = 142) with measurements at baseline, and at 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month postrandomization follow-ups. We identified central symptoms and bridge symptoms and tested whether centrality values calculated at baseline were related to the prognostic utility of symptoms longitudinally. Feeling fat and fear of weight gain were among the most central symptoms of AN. Feelings of worthlessness had the highest bridge centrality connecting depression to AN. Symptom centrality at baseline was strongly related to prognostic utility (r2 = .52, .55).

Correspondingly, social mindfulness has been proposed to involve processes of executive functioning and thus of deliberate thinking. In four studies, we tested the influence of processing mode on social mindfulness using different experimental manipulations (i.e., instructions to decide intuitively vs. deliberately, time pressure, and cognitive load). Contrary to the idea that social mindfulness requires conscious processing – and unlike recent findings suggesting intuitive cooperation – we consistently found negligible effect sizes for the influence of processing mode on social mindfulness. This was observable for both, prosocial and selfish individuals alike (i.e., those with high vs. low levels in Social Value Orientation or Honesty-Humility, respectively). Overall, the findings suggest that social mindfulness constitutes a general tendency to perceive and act prosocially in social situations that is unaffected by processing mode and, by implication, distinguishable from other types of prosocial behavior.",2018-01-01,2018-04-05T23:51:01Z,2018-04-05T23:51:21Z,2018-04-05T23:51:01Z,85-97,NA,NA,74,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Think it through before making a choice?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DQFGVWP3\Mischkowski et al. - 2018 - Think it through before making a choice Processin.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GEDBWHLK\S0022103117302858.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Processing mode; Intuition versus deliberation; Prosocial personality; Social mindfulness; Spontaneous cooperation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000313

We illustrate how disgust may impede learning, as compared to the more commonly studied emotion of anxiety. Disgust and anxiety are natural reactions to many kinds of political threats, but the two emotions influence political engagement in different ways. This study investigated the distinctive effects of disgust in a series of experiments that manipulated information about the outbreak of an infectious disease. People who felt disgusted by a health threat were less likely to learn crucial facts about the threat and less likely to seek additional information.

We examine how cognitive capabilities affect competitive performance, drawing on two constructs rooted in psychology and economics. A familiar one is analytic skill, the ability to solve abstract problems. To that, we add strategic intelligence — the ability to anticipate competitors' behavior and preempt it. Using incentivized experiments, we measure the constructs in participants, then let them compete for cash in a highly competitive market. Although the market is designed to eliminate any advantages, whether from market structure or strategic resources, some profit much more than others. We trace performance differences to heterogeneity in analytic skill and strategic intelligence, and show how the two fuel superior performance, even against tough competition. Managerial summary: Why do some entrepreneurs outperform others? How can companies succeed against tough competition? Certainly, some benefit from unique resources, such as patents, and others can winnow competition, as through mergers. But some have entered highly competitive markets, lacking obvious resources, yet managed to achieve impressive success: think Under Armour, Wal-Mart or Home Depot. Here we test how advantage can stem from managerial cognition. We measure two kinds of cognitive skill in market participants, and then let them vie for cash in intensely competitive markets. Some end up with far more profit than others. Tracing the root of high performance, we find it is predicted by a combination of analytic skills, the ability to solve abstract problems, and strategic intelligence—ability to anticipate competitors' behavior and preempt it.

By contrast, how grouping influences the allocation of attention over time is much less clear. This study investigated this issue, using an attentional blink (AB) paradigm to test how grouping influences the initial selection and the subsequent short-term memory consolidation of a target. On a given trial, two red Kanizsa-type targets (T1 and T2) with varying grouping strength were embedded in a rapid serial visual presentation stream of irrelevant distractors. Our results showed the typical AB finding: impaired identification of T2 when presented close in time following T1. Moreover, the AB was modulated by the T2 grouping—independently of the T1 structure—with stronger grouping leading to a decreased AB and overall higher performance. Conversely, a reversed pattern, namely an increased AB with increasing grouping strength was observed when the Kanizsa figure was not task-relevant. Together, these findings suggest that the grouping benefit emerges at early perceptual stages, automatically drawing attentional resources, thereby leading to either sustained benefits or transient costs—depending on the task-relevance of the grouped object.

Unexpectedly, we found few relationships between differentiation and the selection of putatively adaptive or maladaptive strategies. Instead, we found interactions between differentiation and strategies in predicting negative emotion. Among low differentiators, all strategies (Study 1) and four of six strategies (Study 2) were more strongly associated with increased negative emotion than they were among high differentiators. This suggests that low differentiation may hinder successful emotion regulation, which in turn supports the idea that effective regulation may underlie differentiation benefits.",2019-06-01,2020-01-29T05:57:52Z,2020-01-29T05:58:05Z,2020-01-29T05:57:52Z,863-879,NA,6,30,NA,Psychol Sci,Differentiate to Regulate,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9KBXTWQN\Kalokerinos et al. - 2019 - Differentiate to Regulate Low Negative Emotion Di.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,experience sampling; open data; open materials; emotions; emotion differentiation; emotion regulation; emotional control,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000324

In Study 2, we recruited a similar sample and tested whether fast-responding effects were moderated by the extent to which people display a good-true-self bias.

In humans, hyperinsulinemia associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk for developing AD and both diseases share similar age-related etiologies including amyloidogenesis. Since we have demonstrated that soluble A?42 elicits glutamate release, we wanted to understand how diet-induced insulin resistance alters hippocampal glutamate dynamics, which are important for memory formation and consolidation. Eight to twelve-week-old C57BL/6J and A?PP/PS1 mice were placed on either a low-fat diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 months. A HFD led to significant weight increases as well as impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and learning in both C57BL/6J and A?PP/PS1 mice. A?PP/PS1 low-fat diet mice had elevated hippocampal basal as well as stimulus-evoked glutamate release that was further increased with consumption of a HFD. Immunohistochemistry indicated an increase in vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein density in hippocampal subregions corresponding with this elevated extracellular glutamate. While no differences in hippocampal plaque load were observed, the elevated astrogliotic response surrounding the plaques in A?PP/PS1 HFD mice may have been a compensatory mechanism to control plaque accumulation. These data support that A?PP/PS1 mice have chronically elevated extracellular glutamate that is exacerbated by a HFD and that modifiable lifestyle factors such as obesity-induced insulin resistance can contribute to AD pathogenesis.

We asked if concerns for group reputation might determine how people respond to the moral indiscretions of group members. In four studies, participants read about an immoral act committed by a member of their political party. The act was either publicly known to people outside of the participant's political party (i.e., “public transgression”) or hidden from public view (i.e., “private transgression”). In the public transgression condition, participants endorsed having their political party openly denounce the transgressor in an apparent effort to prevent the party's reputation from being tarnished by association. In the private transgression condition, however, they were reluctant to publicly report the transgressive party member, presumably to prevent reputational loss. Feelings of responsibility for the group arising from either identity fusion with the party or being experimentally assigned to occupy a position of responsibility for the party amplified these effects. Strongly fused participants were even willing to contemplate extreme, unethical actions aimed at protecting party reputation (e.g. tampering with incriminating evidence), regardless of the publicness of the transgression.

Emerging evidence suggests that the physical coordination involved in synchronizing one's behavior with another engages the cognitive systems involved in reasoning about others' mental states (i.e., mentalizing). In three experiments (N=959), we demonstrate that physically moving in synchrony with others fosters some features of mentalizing – a core feature of human social cognition. In small groups, participants moved synchronously or asynchronously with others in a musical performance task. In Experiment 1, we found that synchrony, as compared to asynchrony, increased self-reported tendencies and abilities for considering others' mental states. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding, but found that this effect did not extend to accuracy in mental state recognition. In Experiment 3, we tested synchrony's effects on diverse mentalizing measures and compared performance to both asynchrony and a no-movement control condition. Results indicated that synchrony decreased mental state attribution to socially non-relevant targets, and increased mental state attribution to specifically those with whom participants had synchronized. These results provide novel evidence for how synchrony, a common feature of cultural practices and day-to-day interpersonal coordination, shapes our sociality by engaging mentalizing capacities.",2018-01-01,2018-04-05T23:58:42Z,2018-04-05T23:58:52Z,2018-04-05T23:58:42Z,281-290,NA,NA,74,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Coordinating bodies and minds,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QBEZ79LE\Baimel et al. - 2018 - Coordinating bodies and minds Behavioral synchron.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KPHRQCYX\S0022103117303931.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Interpersonal coordination; Mentalizing; Mind perception; Perspective taking; Synchrony,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000332

However, researchers have not yet systematically investigated why individuals ostracize others. One impediment to this research is lacking multiple means to successfully induce individuals to be sources, those who ostracize others. Using Cyberball, researchers found participants ostracized a player delaying the game. To aid in systematic research on sources, we developed the game Atimia.

Here, we examined the behavioral dynamics of a novel, multiagent shepherding task, in which pairs of individuals had to corral small herds of virtual sheep in the center of a virtual game field. Initially, all pairs adopted a complementary, search-and-recover mode of behavioral coordination, in which both members corralled sheep predominantly on their own sides of the field. Over the course of game play, however, a significant number of pairs spontaneously discovered a more effective mode of behavior: coupled oscillatory containment, in which both members synchronously oscillated around the sheep. Analysis and modeling revealed that both modes were defined by the task’s underlying dynamics and, moreover, reflected context-specific realizations of the lawful dynamics that define functional shepherding behavior more generally.",2017-05-01,2018-03-20T00:35:38Z,2018-03-20T00:36:00Z,2018-03-20T00:35:38Z,630-650,NA,5,28,NA,Psychol Sci,Herd Those Sheep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I9ALW9VN\Nalepka et al. - 2017 - Herd Those Sheep Emergent Multiagent Coordination.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000340

To test the functional relevance of M1 to action prediction, we used offline monopolar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In four tDCS groups of healthy participants, we administered 15 min of anodal or cathodal constant currents of 1 or 2 mA over the left M1 before participants performed two tasks requiring them to make predictions about the outcomes of reaching-grasping human actions (Action Prediction – AP) or non-human movements (Non-human Prediction – NP). In each group, participants received sham and active tDCS in two separate sessions. We found that 2 mA cathodal tDCS (c-tDCS2mA) selectively impaired accuracy in the AP task, but not in the NP task. No change in performance was found following anodal or 1-mA tDCS protocols. Additionally, no change was found following c-tDCS2mA administered over a control site. These findings show task-, polarity-, intensity- and site-specific disruption of AP abilities following c-tDCS2mA over M1. Thus, our study establishes specific tDCS parameters for effective M1 stimulation in AP and highlights the functional relevance of the motor system to making accurate predictions about the outcomes of human actions.",2018-12-01,2019-03-29T09:41:08Z,2019-03-29T09:41:22Z,2019-03-29T09:41:08Z,287-302,NA,NA,109,NA,Cortex,Primary motor cortex crucial for action prediction,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9JVE68FN\Paracampo et al. - 2018 - Primary motor cortex crucial for action prediction.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CBB2XZYD\S0010945218303186.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Action observation network; Action prediction; Non-invasive brain stimulation; Primary motor cortex; Transcranial direct current stimulation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000341

When people see other groups as different, e.g., members of a different race or ethnicity, the perceived boundary often obstructs people from extending trust. This may result in interracial conflicts. The current research argues that individual differences in the lay theory of race can systematically influence the degree to which people extend trust to a racial outgroup in conflict situations. The lay theory of race refers to the extent to which people believe race is a malleable social construct that can change over time (i.e., social constructionist beliefs) versus a fixed essence that differentiates people into meaningful social categories (i.e., essentialist beliefs). In our three studies, we found evidence that social constructionist (vs. essentialist) beliefs promoted interracial trust in intergroup contexts, and that this effect held regardless of whether the lay theory of race was measured (Studies 1 and 3) or manipulated (Study 2), and whether the conflict was presented in a team conflict scenario (Study 1), social dilemma (Study 2), or a face-to-face dyadic negotiation (Study 3). In addition, results revealed that the lay theory's effect on interracial trust could have critical downstream consequences in conflict, namely cooperation and mutually beneficial negotiation outcomes. The findings together reveal that the lay theory of race can reliably influence interracial trust and presents a promising direction for understanding interracial relations and improving intergroup harmony in society.",2018-01-01,2018-04-05T23:51:49Z,2018-04-05T23:51:59Z,2018-04-05T23:51:49Z,121-134,NA,NA,74,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Bridging racial divides,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\73DS4TF7\Kung et al. - 2018 - Bridging racial divides Social constructionist (v.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QKRN9P54\S0022103117302706.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Conflict; Intergroup; Interracial; Lay theory; Trust,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000342

This study charted the time course of monitoring in monolingual English speakers and bilingual Dutch–English speakers in language production and language comprehension, with the aim of pinpointing the component(s) of monitoring that cause an L2 disadvantage. First, we asked whether phonological errors are interrupted more slowly in L2. An analysis of data from three speech error elicitation experiments indeed showed that Dutch–English bilinguals were slower to stop speaking after an error had been detected in their L2 (English) than in their L1 (Dutch), at least for interrupted errors. A similar L2 disadvantage was found when comparing the L2 of Dutch–English bilinguals to the L1 of English monolinguals. Second, monolingual English speakers and bilingual Dutch–English speakers performed a picture naming task, a production monitoring task, and a comprehension monitoring task. Bilingual English speakers were slower in naming pictures in their L2 than monolingual English speakers. However, the production monitoring task and comprehension monitoring task yielded comparable response latencies between monolinguals in their L1 and bilinguals in their L2, indicating that monitoring processes in L2 are not generally slower.

We simulated several levels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity, and used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature.

Therefore, we recommend that meta-analysts in psychology focus on sensitivity analyses—that is, report on a variety of methods, consider the conditions under which these methods fail (as indicated by simulation studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might change depending on which conditions are most plausible. Moreover, given the dependence of meta-analytic methods on untestable assumptions, we strongly recommend that researchers in psychology continue their efforts to improve the primary literature and conduct large-scale, preregistered replications.

Unlike English and Mandarin, Korean does not have lexical stress. Participants completed a visual-world eye-tracking experiment that examined whether listeners? word recognition is constrained by suprasegmental cues to stress alone or by a combination of segmental and suprasegmental cues. Results showed that English listeners used both suprasegmental cues alone and segmental and suprasegmental cues together to recognize English words, with the effect of stress being greater for combined cues. Conversely, Mandarin listeners used stress in lexical access only when stress was signaled by suprasegmental cues alone, and Korean listeners did so only when stress was signaled by segmental and suprasegmental cues together.

The contribution of those factors to protein levels is under debate, as transcript levels and cognate protein levels do not necessarily correlate due to regulation of translation and protein turnover. Here we propose neuronal polarity as a third factor that is particularly evident in the CNS, leading to considerable distances between somata and axon terminals. Consequently, transcript levels may negatively correlate with cognate protein levels in CNS regions, i.e., transcript and protein levels behave reciprocally. To test this hypothesis, we performed an integrative inter-omics study and analyzed three interconnected rat auditory brainstem regions (cochlear nuclear complex, CN; superior olivary complex, SOC; inferior colliculus, IC) and the rest of the brain as a reference. We obtained transcript and protein sets in these regions of interest (ROIs) by DNA microarrays and label-free mass spectrometry, and performed principal component and correlation analyses. We found 508 transcript|protein pairs and detected poor to moderate transcript|protein correlation in all ROIs, as evidenced by coefficients of determination from 0.34 to 0.54. We identified 57-80 negatively correlating gene products in the ROIs and intensively analyzed four of them for which the correlation was poorest. Three cognate proteins (Slc6a11, Syngr1, Tppp) were synaptic and hence candidates for a negative correlation because of protein transport into axon terminals. Thus, we systematically analyzed the negatively correlating gene products. Gene ontology analyses revealed overrepresented transport/synapse-related proteins, supporting our hypothesis. We present 30 synapse/transport-related proteins with poor transcript|protein correlation. In conclusion, our analyses support that protein transport in polar cells is a third factor that influences the protein level and, thereby, the transcript|protein correlation.

Here, we present the results of 4 studies and an internal meta-analysis that examine how people reason about discrimination based on whether it was attributed to the implicit or explicit attitudes of the perpetrators. Participants' perceptions of perpetrator accountability, support for punishment, level of concern about the bias, and support for various efforts to reduce it (e.g., education) were assessed. Taken together, the results suggest that perpetrators of discrimination are held less accountable and often seen as less worthy of punishment when their behavior is attributed to implicit rather than to explicit bias. Moreover, at least under some circumstances, people express less concern about, and are less likely to support efforts to combat, implicit compared with explicit bias.

We devise a test of social theories of protest that hold that participation depends on exposure to others' intentions and network position determines exposure.

Results reveal that both dishonest and honest people exploit the freedom to choose a partner.

Previous studies, however, confounded cognitive flexibility regarding voluntary task choices with control processes during task execution. We present five experiments to dissociate these two processes by means of a double registration procedure, in which task choice is registered prior to task execution. The data yielded clear evidence for reward-driven modulation of the flexibility-stability balance already at the level of task choices, with higher voluntary switch rates when reward prospect increased compared with situations in which reward prospect remained high. This effect was further modulated by the specific type of registration procedure, suggesting that only deliberate task choices are affected by the reward sequence.

The impact of strain from balancing these multiple roles was investigated considering student satisfaction within different domains (i.e., work, family, and school) as a predictor of students’ negative affect in a sample of working college students from across the country (via MTurk; N = 145). Participants were required to be enrolled in a university or college at least part time, employed at least part time, and living with another person. Results revealed that social integration was negatively associated with negative affect across domains.

Here, we examined a previously unexplored domain: speech motor learning. We investigated whether speech motor learning in unimpaired participants can be enhanced using a single-session tDCS experiment, and investigated whether the timing of tDCS relative to a behavioral task affected performance. Participants (N = 80) performed a twenty minute learning task with nonwords containing non-native consonant clusters (e.g., GDEEVOO), and were assigned to groups receiving either sham or active tDCS either immediately before or during the task. Both accuracy and properties of errors were examined throughout the course of the practice task, and then practice was compared to a retention period 30 min later (R1) and two days later (R2). For cluster and whole-(non)word accuracy measures, acquisition was observed for all groups during the practice session. Compared to the beginning of practice, the tDCS-Before group showed significantly greater improvement than both the sham group and the tDCS-During group at R1. An effect was also observed for vowel duration in errors (/gdivu/ → [gədivu]), with the tDCS-Before group showing significant shortening of vowel errors throughout practice. Overall, the findings suggest that tDCS can improve speech motor learning, and that the improvement may be greater when tDCS is applied immediately before practice, warranting further exploration of this new domain for tDCS research.",2019-02-01,2019-03-29T09:25:30Z,2019-03-29T09:25:41Z,2019-03-29T09:25:30Z,274-285,NA,NA,111,NA,Cortex,Using tDCS to facilitate motor learning in speech production,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XTUKKZ27\Buchwald et al. - 2019 - Using tDCS to facilitate motor learning in speech .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GC2WUM4G\S0010945218303861.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Motor control; Motor learning; Speech; tDCS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000358

Three groups of Chinese learners of English (second? and fourth?year English majors and teachers of English) rated the acceptability of 48 un? prefixed verbs and their bare forms. Frequency of bare forms (e.g., close) was a factor associated with the preference of the fourth?year learners and the teachers to reject ungrammatical un? verbs (e.g., unclose). However, competing forms (e.g., open) did not appear to be linked to participants? judgments of the acceptability of ungrammatical un? verbs, lending support to the entrenchment rather than the preemption hypothesis.

This process relies on visual working memory (VWM), which can actively modify its representations. We argue that this ability depends on a pointer system, such that each representation is stably and uniquely mapped to a specific stimulus. Without these pointers, VWM representations are inaccessible and therefore unusable. In three Electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments, we examined whether the pointers are allocated in an object-based, featural, or spatial manner: three factors that were confounded in previous studies. We used a feature change-detection task, in which objects moved and could separate into independently-moving parts. Despite the movement and separation being completely task-irrelevant, we found that the separation invalidated the pointers. This happened in a shape task, where the separation changed both the objects and the task-relevant features, but importantly, also in a color task, where the separation destroyed the objects while leaving the task-relevant features intact. Furthermore, even in a color task where all items had identical shapes, object-separation invalidated the pointers. This suggests that objects and not task-relevant features underlie the pointer system. Finally, when each object-part could be individuated already before the separation, the pointers were maintained, suggesting that the pointers are specifically tied to objects rather than locations. These results shed new light on the pointers which underlie VWM performance, demonstrating that the pointer system is object-based regardless of the task requirements.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:37:15Z,2020-01-30T07:41:04Z,2020-01-30T07:37:15Z,362-372,NA,NA,119,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ISPHUJA6\Balaban et al. - 2019 - Neural evidence for an object-based pointer system.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UVQHXAXW\S0010945219302023.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Object-based attention; Pointer system; Resetting; Updating; Visual working memory,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000361

Fifty undergraduates learned positive and negative information about racial in-group (Latino) and out-group (African American) targets. Participants returned after both a short time delay (2–6 hr after the learning session) and a long time delay (48 hr after the learning session) to complete a lexical decision task.

First, we conceptualize and measure secular orientations in a new way—not just as the absence of religion, but also as an affirmative secular identity and positive commitment to secular principles. Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal effect on religious and secular orientations.

Alternative accounts posit that purported effects are instead due to nonperceptual processes, such as response bias. Despite much confirmatory research on both sides of the debate, researchers who promote a response-bias account have never used the Pong task, which has yielded one of the most robust action-specific effects. Conversely, researchers who promote a perceptual account have rarely used the opposition’s preferred test for response bias, namely, the postexperiment survey. The current experiments rectified this. We found that even for people naive to the experiment’s hypothesis, the ability to block a moving ball affected the ball’s perceived speed.

In two studies we tested whether, through fairness perceptions, regulatory fit relates to greater openness to change, especially when that change has negative consequences for its recipients. Study 1 was a field experiment conducted among primary and middle school teachers who, respectively, expected positive versus negative outcomes from an actual major education change in Poland. We manipulated message framing, describing the prospected change in a promotion-related or prevention-related way. We measured processing fluency, engagement, process fairness, and change openness. Study 2 was a vignette experiment where college graduates assessed their openness to a change in university policy regarding credits for research participation. We randomized change framing (promotion vs. prevention) and outcome (positive vs. negative) between the participants. Supporting the predictions, the decision process regarding the change was perceived as more fair when the message framing matched recipients' regulatory focus. In line with our expectations, perceived fairness was linked with increased openness towards the change especially among individuals who could be hurt by the changes. In both studies, the fairness mechanism was crucial under these circumstances as compared to the competing mechanism of engagement (and fluency in Study 1).",2019-11-01,2020-02-06T02:00:42Z,2020-02-10T04:00:51Z,2020-02-06T02:00:42Z,103882,NA,NA,85,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Messaging organizational change,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YSRPB6BN\Roczniewska and Higgins - 2019 - Messaging organizational change How regulatory fi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\59ST58IM\S0022103118303767.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000370

This article approaches the right versus left libertarian debate by developing a formal model that examines the welfare properties of different interpretations of the Lockean proviso.

In four experiments we investigated the influence of social categorization and membership on economic decision-making and inequality aversion. Specifically, we used a modified version of the Third Party Ultimatum Game, in which participants played the role of responder and were instructed to make decisions for themselves or another individual (i.e. the receiver of the economic offer) who was an ingroup or outgroup member. Experiments 1–2 (N = 173) showed that the participants were more likely to accept unequal-advantageous offers when the receivers were ingroup rather than outgroup members. Experiment 3 (N = 121) supported previous findings and suggested the intervening role played by perceived intergroup competition. Experiment 4 (N = 61) explored the effect boundary conditions. Findings revealed that, even when responder's utility is linked to the receiver's utility, the receiver's membership exerted its influence when the responders were highly identified with the ingroup. A final small-scale meta-analysis confirmed the robustness of our findings. Taken together, these results integrate research on economic decision-making and intergroup bias and suggest that the utility target's membership can resolve the conflict between inequality aversion and utility maximization.",2018-07-01,2019-03-30T16:34:38Z,2019-03-30T16:34:49Z,2019-03-30T16:34:38Z,117-131,NA,NA,77,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YAJ44I4M\Biella en Sacchi - 2018 - Not fair but acceptable… for us!

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme of catecholamine synthesis, is regulated by multiple neuronal signaling pathways through phosphorylation at serine 19 (Ser19), serine 31 (Ser31), and serine 40 (Ser40) located in the flexible, far N-terminal region of the regulatory domain. Phosphorylated Ser19 (pSer19) provides a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins, a family of multi-target binding adaptor proteins. We hypothesized that pSer19 and 14-3-3 binding can regulate access to the Ser31 and Ser40 sites and modulate the dynamics of their phosphorylation state. To avoid complications from upstream signal interactions and have good control of TH-phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding stoichiometry, we used purified recombinant human TH and 14-3-3 dimer types. We found that pSer19 strongly stimulated Ser31 phosphorylation (4.6-fold), but inhibited pSer31 dephosphorylation (3.4-fold). Binding of 14-3-3ζ counteracted the stimulatory effect of pSer19 on phosphorylation at Ser31, but amplified the effect on its dephosphorylation. In contrast, phosphorylation at Ser19 had moderate effect on pSer40 dephosphorylation, but 14-3-3ζ binding inhibited dephosphorylation, an effect that was consistent across different homo- and heterodimeric 14-3-3s. Additional phosphorylation of Ser31 or Ser40 had little impact on the binding affinity of pSer19 TH to 14-3-3s. Mathematical modeling was performed to elucidate possible physiological implications of these observations. We propose a role of Ser19 and 14-3-3 proteins as modulators of TH phosphorylation in response to neuronal co-signaling events. These mechanisms add to our understanding of the multifaceted roles of phosphorylation and adaptor proteins in cellular signaling.",2020,2020-02-06T02:59:17Z,2020-02-06T02:59:41Z,2020-02-06T02:59:17Z,29-47,NA,1,152,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 The Authors.

The empirical evidence for this hypothesis is weak, however, with existing tests resting on small cross-sectional samples and producing contradictory results. The underlying problem is that survey measures of support for democracy are fragmented across time, space, and different survey questions. In response, this article uses a Bayesian latent variable model to estimate a smooth country-year panel of democratic support for 135 countries and up to 29 years. The article then demonstrates a positive effect of support on subsequent democratic change, while adjusting for the possible confounding effects of prior levels of democracy and unobservable time-invariant factors. Support is, moreover, more robustly linked with the endurance of democracy than its emergence in the first place.

In late life, however, these trends seem to be reversed. Because many changes and transitions in older age are related to health, we investigated correlated changes in health problems and personality traits, the sources of health changes in later life and the directionality of effects. Our sample consisted of older adult twins, aged 64?85 years at time 1 (n = 410; 135 male/275 female; 134 monozygotic/63 dizygotic twin pairs), assessed at two different time points about five years apart, and we ran bivariate latent change and latent change twin model analyses. Increasing health problems were associated with decreases in agreeableness, extraversion, emotional stability and conscientiousness. Changes in health problems were only due to environmental influences, implying that the association between health and personality changes was exclusively environmental. Directional effects were largely absent, but health and personality were significantly related at the second measurement occasion (age 69?89 years). Our results support the link between health change and personality change in late life and spark the assumption of normative personality adaptations to deterioration of health status as a means of developmental regulation.

Motivating this possibility, neurocomputational models propose that the hippocampus’s capacity to support associative recollection (pattern completion) is biased by persistent neurochemical states, which can be elicited by exposure to familiarity and novelty. We investigated these models’ behavioral implications by assessing how recent familiarity influences different memory-retrieval processes.

This truth bias was predicted by Whites’ motivation to respond without prejudice. For Black participants, however, motives to respond without prejudice did not moderate responses (Study 2). In Study 3, we found similar effects with a manipulation of the targets’ apparent race. Finally, in Study 4, we used eye-tracking techniques to demonstrate that Whites’ truth bias for Black targets is likely the result of late-stage correction processes: Despite ultimately judging that Black targets were telling the truth more often than White targets, Whites were faster to fixate on the on-screen “lie” response box when targets were Black than when targets were White. These systematic race-based biases have important theoretical implications (e.g., for lie detection and improving intergroup communication and relations) and practical implications (e.g., for reducing racial bias in law enforcement).",2017-08-01,2018-03-20T00:16:25Z,2018-03-20T00:16:50Z,2018-03-20T00:16:25Z,1125-1136,NA,8,28,NA,Psychol Sci,Black and White Lies,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QIHT52WM\Lloyd et al. - 2017 - Black and White Lies Race-Based Biases in Decepti.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000380

Grounded in social schema research, we hypothesize that a future-orientation is a means to broaden thinking through activating change and progress schemas, which in turn facilitates creativity. We first offered qualitative evidence that people generally hold a schema that the future is inundated with change and progress. In three experimental studies, we established the creative benefit of future-oriented (vs. present-oriented) thinking in divergent thinking tasks. Further, we offered support that schemas of change and progress mediate the link between future-oriented (vs. present-oriented) thinking and creativity (Study 2) and demonstrated the causal role of schema activation by manipulating accessibility of change and progress schemas under a future-orientation (Study 3).

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) regulates neuroinflammation, clears extracellular Amyloid (A)-?, surveys for damaged neurons, and orchestrates microglial differentiation. TREM2 has not been studied in HIV+ brain tissues. In this retrospective study, we investigated TREM2 expression levels and localization to microglia, A? protein levels, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α transcript levels in the frontal cortices of 52 HIV+ decedents. All donors had been on ART; 14 were cognitively normal (CN), 17 had an asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), and 21 had a minor neurocognitive disorder (MND). Total TREM2 protein levels were increased in the soluble and decreased in the membrane-enriched fractions of MND brain tissues compared to CN; however, brains from MND Hispanics showed the most robust alterations in TREM2 as well as significantly increased TNF-α mRNA and A? levels when compared to CN Hispanics. Significant alterations in the expression of total TREM2 protein and transcripts for TNF-α were not observed in non-Hispanics, despite higher levels of A? in the non-Hispanic CN group compared to the non-Hispanic MND groups. These findings show that decreased and increased TREM2 in membrane-bound fractions and in soluble-enriched fractions, respectively, is associated with increased A? and neuroinflammation in this cohort of HIV+ brains, particularly those identifying as Hispanics. These findings suggest a role for TREM2 in the brain of HIV+ individuals may deserve more investigation as a biomarker for HAND and as a possible therapeutic target.

It is well established that emotion intensifies attention. Three experiments reported here (N = 235) demonstrated the reversed causal direction: Voluntary visual attention intensifies perceived emotion. In Experiment 1, participants repeatedly directed attention toward a target object during sequential search. Participants subsequently perceived their emotional reactions to target objects as more intense than their reactions to control objects. Experiments 2 and 3 used a spatial-cuing procedure to manipulate voluntary visual attention. Spatially cued attention increased perceived emotional intensity. Participants perceived spatially cued objects as more emotionally intense than noncued objects even when participants were asked to mentally rehearse the name of noncued objects. This suggests that the intensifying effect of attention is independent of more extensive mental rehearsal.

Members of the subfamily Colobinae are unique amongst extant primates in that their gastrointestinal systems more closely resemble those of ruminants than other members of the primate order. In the growing literature surrounding nonhuman primate microbiomes, analysis of microbial communities has been limited to the hindgut, since few studies have captured data on other gut sites, including the foregut of colobine primates. In this study, we used the red-shanked douc (Pygathrix nemaeus) as a model for colobine primates to study the relationship between gastrointestinal bacterial community structure and gut site within and between subjects. We analyzed fecal and pregastric stomach content samples, representative of the hindgut and foregut respectively, using 16S recombinant DNA (rDNA) sequencing and identified microbiota using closed-reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking against the GreenGenes database. Our results show divergent bacterial communities clearly distinguish the foregut and hindgut microbiomes. We found higher bacterial biodiversity and a higher Firmicutes:Bacteroides ratio in the hindgut as opposed to the foregut. These gut sites showed strong associations with bacterial function. Specifically, energy metabolism was upregulated in the hindgut, whereas detoxification was increased in the foregut. Our results suggest a red-shanked douc's foregut microbiome is no more concordant with its own hindgut than it is with any other red-shanked douc's hindgut microbiome, thus reinforcing the notion that the bacterial communities of the foregut and hindgut are distinctly unique.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms and the SoA over thoughts. Participants were told that subliminal auditory primes (actually sham) can insert thoughts into their minds, and their experiences of inserted thoughts were collected online. The results of three experiments showed reduced SoA over thoughts in individuals with subclinical OC symptoms, regardless of the valence of the thoughts. Several potential confounding factors (e.g., suppression, vigilance, general anxiety) were ruled out. The experience of inserted thoughts was related to experiencing thoughts as “out of context,” which partially explained reduced SoA in participants with high levels of OC symptoms.

To investigate this question, we analyzed gender distributions in publicly available federal funding data from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada that are specific to cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. There were three key results. First, the proportion of women cognitive scientists progressively diminished at each career stage, particularly at the transition between graduate and postdoctoral studies. Second, female principal investigators (PI) received smaller average Discovery Grant amounts and were less likely to receive Discovery Accelerator Supplements as a proportion of all Discovery Grants funded. Finally, at the PI level, gender differences were relatively smaller for institution-initiated grants (i.e., Canada Research Chairs) versus investigator-initiated grants (i.e., Discovery Grants). It is our hope that presentation of such data, in concert with other recent reports for our field (e.g., Klatzky, Holt, & Behrmann, 2015; Peelle, 2016; Vaid & Geraci, 2016), continues to raise awareness that gender parity issues remain a concern that deserves ongoing attention within the field of cognitive science in Canada.

Christian Salvesen Whaling Company logbooks from whaling ships operating in the Southern Ocean, starting from the 1930s through the 1950s, are examined. Meteorological information contained in these logbooks has been extracted to produce a historical climate dataset. We discuss various instructions recommended by the British Admiralty to observe and record weather conditions on-board whaling ships. Statistical tests were used to flag erroneous values and corrections were made using neighbouring values. Meteorological parameters such as air pressure, air and sea temperature and wind force on the Beaufort scale were standardized, converting imperial to metric units. The data were structured according to the internationally accepted International Maritime Meteorological Archive format, which includes the most commonly reported meteorological variables, including the time, location and ship-related meta-data. Hence, a readily accessible, error-corrected and standardized historical climate dataset of the Weddell Sea sector of the Southern Ocean is presented.

Research shows Asian second language (L2) learners of English struggle to produce bridging reference appropriately, yet little research has been done on the L2 production of bridging in Asian languages. We collected oral picture sequence narrative data from 80 lower-intermediate L2 Mandarin learners from first language (L1) English (+ article, n = 23) and L1 Korean and Japanese (- article, n = 57) backgrounds, alongside equivalent L1 data. Speakers of article-L1s were more likely than those from article-less L1s to use numeral + classifier noun phrases (NPs) for nonbridging referents and demonstrative + classifier NPs when introducing bridging referents, essentially (and infelicitously) using these constructions as de facto English-like indefinite/definite articles in their L2 Mandarin production.

We hypothesized that children with an older sister have better language abilities than children with an older brother, especially when there is a large age gap between the two siblings. We reanalyzed data from the EDEN cohort (N = 1,154) and found that children with an older sister had better language skills than those with an older brother. Contrary to predictions, results showed that the age gap between siblings was not associated with language skills and did not interact with sex. Results suggest that the negative effect of older siblings on language development may be entirely due to the role of older brothers.

Although monitoring and controlling one’s knowledge is a key feature of human cognition, its evolutionary origins are debated. In the current study, we examined whether rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta; N = 120) could make metacognitive inferences in a one-shot decision. Each monkey experienced one of four conditions, observing a human appearing to hide a food reward in an apparatus consisting of either one or two tubes. The monkeys tended to search the correct location when they observed this baiting event, but engaged in information seeking—by peering into a center location where they could check both potential hiding spots—if their view had been occluded and information seeking was possible. The monkeys only occasionally approached the center when information seeking was not possible.

We have employed a label-free proteomic approach that allows quantification of large numbers of brain-expressed proteins in a single analysis in the mouse (male C57BL/6J) kainate (KA) model of epileptogenesis. In addition, we have incorporated two putative antiepileptogenic drugs, postsynaptic density protein-95 blocking peptide (PSD95BP or Tat-NR2B9c) and a highly selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 1400W, to give an insight into how such agents might ameliorate epileptogenesis. The test drugs were administered after the induction of status epilepticus (SE) and the animals were euthanized at 7 days, their hippocampi removed, and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. A total of 2,579 proteins were identified; their normalized abundance was compared between treatment groups using ANOVA, with correction for multiple testing by false discovery rate. Significantly altered proteins were subjected to gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. KA-induced SE was most robustly associated with an alteration in the abundance of proteins involved in neuroinflammation, including heat shock protein beta-1 (HSP27), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and CD44 antigen. Treatment with PSD95BP or 1400W moderated the abundance of several of these proteins plus that of secretogranin and Src substrate cortactin. Pathway analysis identified the glutamatergic synapse as a key target for both drugs. Our observations require validation in a larger-scale investigation, with candidate proteins explored in more detail. Nevertheless, this study has identified several mechanisms by which epilepsy might develop and several targets for novel drug development. Open Practices This article has been awarded Open Data.

This phenomenon helps us organize our complex social world and ultimately it shapes our interaction with others. The goal of this manuscript is 1) to conduct a systematic analysis of the different types of measures that are currently used to detect inferences, 2) to identify their main limitations and 3) to propose a new paradigm that overcomes most of these limitations. The new paradigm is based on the modified free association task that Hourihan and MacLeod (2007) proposed as a pure conceptual implicit memory measure. This new paradigm simultaneously overcomes the contamination problem of memory measures and the dependency on data-driven processing of the activation measures. In the presented experiments we use the modified free association paradigm to detect STIs and also to compare its results to the naming task and the modified Stroop task. We show that this measure is able to reliably detect STI and discuss why it is more appropriate to study inferences.

Specifically, decision-difficulty is expressed as proximity, for instance when people say that a decision was “too close to call”. Although these expressions are metaphorical, we argue, in line with research on conceptual metaphor theory, that they reflect how people think about difficult decisions. Thus, here we examine whether close spatial distance can actually make decision-making harder. In six experiments (total N = 672), participants chose between two choice options presented either close together or far apart. As predicted, close (rather than far) choice options led to more difficulty, both in self-report (Experiment 1A–1C) and behavioral measures (decision-time, Experiment 2 and 3). Identifying a boundary condition, we show that close choice options lead to more difficulty only for within-category choices (Experiment 3). The too-close-to-call effect is theoretically and methodologically relevant for a broad array of research where choice options are visually presented, ranging from social cognition, judgment and decision-making to more applied settings in consumer psychology and marketing.",2020-03-01,2020-02-06T01:29:44Z,2020-02-10T11:50:26Z,2020-02-06T01:29:43Z,103939,NA,NA,87,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Too close to call,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QJDRSIP4\Schneider et al. - 2020 - Too close to call Spatial distance between option.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\85SXEC6H\S0022103118308035.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Decision-making; Choice; Metaphor; Consumer behavior; Spatial distance,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000405

To effectively summarize different groups of objects into the gist of a scene, observers should form ensembles separately for different groups, even when objects have similar visual features across groups. We hypothesized that the visual system utilizes perceptual groups characterized by spatial configuration and represents separate ensembles for different groups. Therefore, participants could not integrate ensembles of different perceptual groups on a task basis. We asked participants to determine the average orientation of visual elements comprising a surface with a contour situated inside. Although participants were asked to estimate the average orientation of all the elements, they ignored orientation signals embedded in the contour.

We put this assumption to the test by seeking electrophysiological markers of encoding a perceptual dimension. Participants categorized a colored letter as a vowel or consonant or its color as “warm” or “cold.” Orthogonally to the color manipulation, some colors were eight times more frequent than others, and the letters were in upper- or lowercase. Color frequency modulated the electroencephalogram amplitude at around 150 ms when participants repeated the color-classification task.

We posit that there may be two types of deviation, burdensome and non-burdensome, and the former is most likely to be ostracized. Study 1 manipulated burdensome deviation by programming a group member to perform more slowly (8 or 16 sec.) than others (4 sec.) in a virtual ball-toss game. Participants perceived slower players as more burdensome and deviate than normal speed players. Additionally, participants ostracized (gave fewer ball tosses to) the slowest player. Study 2 examined participant responses to both burdensome deviation (8- and 16-sec. players) and non-burdensome deviation (goth appearance).

We found that pupils were largest for words conveying darkness, of intermediate size for neutral words, and smallest for words conveying brightness. This pattern was found for both visually presented and spoken words, which suggests that it was due to the words’ meanings, rather than to visual or auditory properties of the stimuli.

We compared the effect of memory retrieval and context inferences on short- and long-term retention in three experiments. Participants studied novel words and then practiced the words either in an uninformative context that required the retrieval of word meaning from memory (?I need the funguo?) or in an informative context from which word meaning could be inferred (?I want to unlock the door: I need the funguo?). The informative context facilitated word comprehension during practice. However, later recall of word form and meaning and word recognition in a new context were better after successful retrieval practice and retrieval practice with feedback than after context-inference practice. These findings suggest benefits of retrieval during contextualized vocabulary learning whereby the uninformative context enhanced word retention by triggering memory retrieval.

The regulation of nAChRs has been mainly studied in vertebrates, especially in mammals. Here, two types of nAChRs were found present in the locust Locusta migratoria manilensis dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons, α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt)-sensitive nAChRs and α-Bgt-resistant nAChRs, responding to acetylcholine (ACh) at different concentrations. The homologs to three mammalian nAChR regulators, ubiquilin-1, CRELD2 (cysteine-rich with EFG-like domain 2), and PICK1 (protein interacting with PRKCA 1), were characterized in L. migratoria, and their functions on regulating native nAChRs were investigated via RNAi followed by membrane potential measurement with DiBAC4(3) and agonist-evoked macroscopic current recording in cultured L. migratoria DUM neurons. Ubiquilin-1 and PICK1 negatively regulated nAChRs because silencing of ubiquilin-1 and PICK1 both resulted in increased membrane potential and increased inward currents in DUM neurons, while CRELD2 positively regulated nAChRs as decreased membrane potential and inward currents were observed in DUM neurons. In addition, ubiquilin-1 regulated both α-Bgt-sensitive and α-Bgt-resistant types of nAChRs whereas PICK1 and CRELD2 regulated only the α-Bgt-resistant nAChRs. The present study broadened our understanding on the regulation of insect nAChRs and will benefit pest management given the important role of nAChRs in insect neurons and insecticide science.

There is also a rapidly growing body of research focused on extending features of adult psychopathy downward to youth. To date however, the degree to which these features can be consistently and comparatively assessed at these younger ages, remains unclear. This study addresses this issue by investigating measurement invariance of underlying features of psychopathy across childhood and adolescence in a racially diverse sample of youth. Methods Three cohorts of youth (n = 1517) were assessed annually from childhood to adolescence (ages  ∼7–16). Underlying features of psychopathy commonly assessed in youth (e.g. lack of guilt, impulsivity) were examined within a longitudinal bi-factor framework using multi-dimensional item-response theory (IRT) techniques. Differential item functioning was used to assess invariance across development and participant’s race (African-American and Caucasian), using two distinct approaches: (1) traditional item-response theory (IRT) methods; and (2) a recently developed Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) approach. Results Psychopathy features assessed in this study exhibited measurement consistency across development (∼ages 7–16) and were found to tap into the same underlying construct as intended across measurement occasions, and equivalently for African-American and Caucasian youth. Results were similar when assessed using traditional IRT procedures for longitudinal invariance testing and when implementing the more recent BSEM methodology. Conclusions Findings provide the first evidence that features of psychopathy can be assessed consistently in youth and improve our understanding of important developmental and sociocultural factors associated these features during earlier periods of development.",2018-04-01,2018-04-06T00:45:52Z,2018-04-06T00:46:01Z,2018-04-06T00:45:52Z,180-188,NA,NA,73,NA,Journal of Research in Personality,Psychopathic features across development,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HWUBKS9F\Hawes et al. - 2018 - Psychopathic features across development Assessin.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K54BRBNC\S0092656618300151.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bayesian; Development; Longitudinal; Measurement invariance; Psychopathy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000417

It has been shown that to exploit such environmental stability, the brain creates a continuity field in which objects seen seconds ago influence the perception of current objects. What is unknown is whether a similar mechanism exists at the level of metacognitive representations. In three experiments, we demonstrated a robust intertask confidence leak—that is, confidence in one’s response on a given task or trial influencing confidence on the following task or trial. This confidence leak could not be explained by response priming or attentional fluctuations. Better ability to modulate confidence leak predicted higher capacity for metacognition as well as greater gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex. A model based on normative principles from Bayesian inference explained the results by postulating that observers subjectively estimate the perceptual signal strength in a stable environment. These results point to the existence of a novel metacognitive mechanism mediated by regions in the prefrontal cortex.",2015-11-01,2018-03-20T01:58:10Z,2018-03-20T01:58:22Z,2018-03-20T01:58:10Z,1664-1680,NA,11,26,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5LZSSW52\Rahnev et al. - 2015 - Confidence Leak in Perceptual Decision Making.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000419

We demonstrate that gender-blindness—a diversity ideology that advocates for downplaying gender differences, rather than embracing them—has the potential to diminish stereotyping of women in STEM fields. In six total studies, we show that men who believe, or are primed with, gender-blindness (compared to gender-awareness) are less likely to endorse gender stereotypes around women's STEM competencies. By measuring (Study 1) and manipulating (Studies 2–5) gender-blindness, we show that gender-blindness (compared to awareness) minimizes the gender gap on explicit stereotyping measures, as well as diminishes STEM stereotyping in target evaluations.

Here, language experience was measured from home audio recordings of 36 SES-diverse 4- to 6-year-old children. During a story-listening functional MRI task, children who had experienced more conversational turns with adults—independently of SES, IQ, and adult-child utterances alone—exhibited greater left inferior frontal (Broca’s area) activation, which significantly explained the relation between children’s language exposure and verbal skill.

Furthermore, results suggest that conversational experience impacts neural language processing over and above SES or the sheer quantity of words heard.",2018-05,2019-04-06T17:54:15Z,2019-04-06T17:54:34Z,2019-04-06T17:54:15Z,700-710,NA,5,29,NA,NA,Beyond the 30-Million-Word Gap,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S3DYR36N\Romeo e.a. - 2018 - Beyond the 30-Million-Word Gap Children’s Convers.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000425

The mitochondrial respiratory chain is considered a major source of ROS; however, there is little agreement on how ROS release depends on oxygen concentration. The rate of H2O2 release by intact brain mitochondria was measured with an Amplex UltraRed assay using a high-resolution respirometer (Oroboros) equipped with a fluorescent optical module and a system of controlled gas flow for varying the oxygen concentration. Three types of substrates were used: malate and pyruvate, succinate and glutamate, succinate alone or glycerol 3-phosphate. For the first time we determined that, with any substrate used in the absence of inhibitors, H2O2 release by respiring brain mitochondria is linearly dependent on the oxygen concentration. We found that the highest rate of H2O2 release occurs in conditions of reverse electron transfer when mitochondria oxidize succinate or glycerol 3-phosphate. H2O2 production by complex III is significant only in the presence of antimycin A and, in this case, the oxygen dependence manifested mixed (linear and hyperbolic) kinetics. We also demonstrated that complex II in brain mitochondria could contribute to ROS generation even in the absence of its substrate succinate when the quinone pool is reduced by glycerol 3-phosphate. Our results underscore the critical importance of reverse electron transfer in the brain, where a significant amount of succinate can be accumulated during ischemia providing a backflow of electrons to complex I at the early stages of reperfusion. Our study also demonstrates that ROS generation in brain mitochondria is lower under hypoxic conditions than in normoxia.

In two speed-dating studies, romantically unattached individuals completed more than 100 self-report measures about traits and preferences that past researchers have identified as being relevant to mate selection. Each participant met each opposite-sex participant attending a speed-dating event for a 4-min speed date.

Our research addresses the neglected impact on more sophisticated behaviors that go beyond psychological processes or basic motor responses. Specifically, in the present research we probed how leaning (approach) versus reclining (avoidance) influence a representative motivated behavior—purchases of rewarding foods—in the context of an online grocery shopping task. We also examined a personality—Behavioral Activation System (BAS)—and a situational—construal level—moderator of this effect. Across Studies 1 and 2, it was established that leaning made people spend more on rewarding foods compared to reclining, but only for individuals high in the drive component of BAS. In Study 3, leaning again enhanced purchases of rewarding foods, but only in a situation that induced low construal level. The moderated effects had strong evidential value across all three studies (as indicated by a p-curve analysis), yet the main effects were significant only in Studies 1 and 3.

This perception appears driven by the view that changes to widely shared moral beliefs would alter friendships and that this change in social relationships would, in turn, alter an individual's personal identity. Because reasoning about identity changes substantially during adolescence, the current work tested pre- and post-adolescents to reveal the role that such changes could play in moral cognition. Experiment 1 showed that 8- to 10-year-olds, like adults, judged that people would change more after changes to their widely shared moral beliefs (e.g., whether hitting is wrong) than after changes to controversial moral beliefs (e.g., whether telling prosocial lies is wrong). Following up on this basic effect, a second experiment examined whether participants regard all changes to widely shared moral beliefs as equally impactful. Adults, but not children, reported that individuals would change more if their good moral beliefs (e.g., it is not okay to hit) transformed into bad moral beliefs (e.g., it is okay to hit) than if the opposite change occurred. This difference in adults was mediated by perceptions of how much changes to each type of belief would alter friendships.

However, most researchers who conduct priming studies fail to explicitly report double-blind procedures. Because experimenter expectations may influence participant behavior, we asked whether a short pre-experiment interaction between participants and experimenters would contribute to priming effects when experimenters were not blind to participant condition. An initial double-blind experiment failed to demonstrate the expected effects of a social prime on executive cognition. To determine whether double-blind procedures caused this result, we independently manipulated participants’ exposure to a prime and experimenters’ belief about which prime participants received. Across four experiments, we found that experimenter belief, rather than prime condition, altered participant behavior.

Because words such as spicy or hot tend to be associated with physical attractiveness, spicy flavor was examined in relation to embodied cognition. Similarly, words such as honey or sweetie tend to be associated with romantic relationships; therefore sweet taste was also examined in relation to embodied cognition. Eighty-seven women were given 1 of 3 snacks: a sweet, spicy, or a nonsweet/ nonspicy snack. As they consumed the snack, they were instructed to look at 3 male faces of high, moderate, and low attractiveness and respond to questions asking about the physical attractiveness and their romantic interest in the men. Two 1-way Analyses of Variance were performed separately on the dependent variables of physical attraction and romantic interest. A significant main effect was found for flavor on both dependent variables.

One soldier fatality implies a 0.13 percentage point reduction in the local health budget share (2008–12). Health budget cuts due to a single soldier fatality result in 76 predicted additional infant deaths 2 years later. We show that the effect on health budgeting operates through decreases in women's use of health facilities and postnatal services.

Herein we describe the procedures for acquiring ship and instrumental metadata and the one-minute interval observations from 44 research vessels that have contributed to the SAMOS initiative from 2005 to 2017. The overall data processing workflow and quality control procedures are documented along with data file formats and version control procedures. The SAMOS data are disseminated to the user community via web, FTP, and Thematic Real-time Environmental Distributed Data Services from both the Marine Data Center at the Florida State University and the National Centers for Environmental Information, which serves as the long-term archive for the SAMOS initiative. They have been used to address topics ranging from air-sea interaction studies, the calibration, evaluation, and development of satellite observational products, the evaluation of numerical atmospheric and ocean models, and the development of new tools and techniques for geospatial data analysis in the informatics community. Maps provide users the geospatial coverage within the SAMOS dataset, with a focus on the Essential Climate/Ocean Variables, and recommendations are made regarding which versions of the dataset should be accessed by different user communities.

Classical liberalism is grounded in individual justice principles, suggesting that individuals are responsible for their own fate and should be treated according to their personal characteristics, regardless of group membership. Multiculturalism, in turn, is grounded in collective justice principles, recognizing cultural differences and seeking greater equality between groups. The present research investigates how asymmetric group membership in dominant and subordinate groups shapes perceived compatibility between classical liberalism and multiculturalism. A correlational study (N = 141) first shows that cultural minorities perceive greater compatibility between the two justice principles compared to native majorities. A second (N = 202) and third (N = 164) experimental study involving the description of a fictitious society manipulated perspective-taking as a function of social status, cultural origin and numerical size of groups. The findings show that respondents taking the perspective of immigrant groups perceive greater compatibility between classical liberalism and multiculturalism as an abstract ideology compared to a native perspective, and that a low status perspective leads to greater compatibility between classical liberalism and multiculturalism as a concrete policy compared to a high status perspective. Overall, these studies suggest that membership in subordinate groups generally increases perceived compatibility between individual and collective forms of justice.

In particular, observers are thought to integrate auditory and visual spatial cues weighted in proportion to their relative sensory reliabilities into the most reliable and unbiased percept consistent with MLE. Yet, evidence to date has been inconsistent. The current pre-registered, large-scale (N = 36) replication study investigated the extent to which human behaviour for audiovisual localization is in line with maximum likelihood estimation. The acquired psychophysics data show that while observers were able to reduce their multisensory variance relative to the unisensory variances in accordance with MLE, they weighed the visual signals significantly stronger than predicted by MLE. Simulations show that this dissociation can be explained by a greater sensitivity of standard estimation procedures to detect deviations from MLE predictions for sensory weights than for audiovisual variances. Our results therefore suggest that observers did not integrate audiovisual spatial signals weighted exactly in proportion to their relative reliabilities for localization. These small deviations from the predictions of maximum likelihood estimation may be explained by observers' uncertainty about the world's causal structure as accounted for by Bayesian causal inference.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:35:33Z,2020-01-30T07:39:52Z,2020-01-30T07:35:33Z,74-88,NA,NA,119,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IU7W4VZI\Meijer et al. - 2019 - Integration of audiovisual spatial signals is not .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DDD4PLI6\S0010945219301583.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Maximum likelihood estimation; Multisensory integration; Multisensory perception; Optimality; Spatial ventriloquism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000446

In this study, we aimed to identify the electrophysiological components associated with goal-directed versus habitual performance using an outcome devaluation procedure. Datasets from 35 healthy participants were analyzed. Behaviorally, in line with previous research, participants displayed sensitivity to outcome devaluation, a hallmark of goal-directed control. Electrophysiologically, decreased N2 and increased error-related negativity (ERN) amplitudes were associated with slips of action in conditions that could potentially engage both the goal-directed and habitual systems.

Furthermore, we show how specific neurophysiological learning signals, namely ERN and feedback-locked P3, could predict subsequent sensitivity to devaluation.

Here, we demonstrate that the juncture at which value and probability information is provided has a fundamental effect on choice. Across four experiments involving 489 participants, we compared two decision-making scenarios: one in which value information was revealed during sampling (standard) and one in which value information was revealed after sampling (value ignorance). On average, participants made riskier choices when value information was provided after sampling. Moreover, parameter estimates from a hierarchical Bayesian implementation of cumulative-prospect theory suggested that participants overweighted rare events when value information was absent during sampling but did not overweight such events in the standard condition. This suggests that the impact of rare events on choice relies crucially on the timing of probability and value integration.

High density may support the formation and fine-tuning of new word sound memories—a process termed lexical configuration (e.g., Storkel, 2004). However, new high-density words are also more likely to be misunderstood as instances of known words, and may therefore fail to trigger the learning process (e.g., Swingley & Aslin, 2007). To examine these apparently contradictory effects, we trained an autoencoder neural network on 587,954 word tokens (5,497 types, including mono- and multisyllabic words of all grammatical classes) spoken by 279 caregivers to English-speaking children aged 18–24 months. We then simulated a communicative development inventory administration and compared network performance to that of 2,292 children aged 18–24 months. We argue that autoencoder performance illustrates concurrent density advantages and disadvantages, in contrast to prior behavioral and computational literature treating such effects independently. Low network error rates signal a configuration advantage for high-density words, while high network error rates signal a triggering advantage for low-density words. This interpretation is consistent with the application of autoencoders in academic research and industry, for simultaneous feature extraction (i.e., configuration) and anomaly detection (i.e., triggering). Autoencoder simulation therefore illustrates how apparently contradictory density and distinctiveness effects can emerge from a common learning mechanism.

In the present study, we sought to bridge some of these divisions by examining activity related to pitch in both neurons and neuronal ensembles within the auditory cortex of the rhesus macaque, a primate species with similar pitch perception and auditory cortical organisation to humans.

Further, the link between patterning and general math knowledge and specific math skills (i.e., numeracy and shape knowledge) was examined. Children’s patterning skills were significantly but only moderately linked to their performance on general cognitive ability measures (e.g., fluid reasoning). Further, beyond the effects of these general cognitive abilities, patterning significantly predicted both general math and numeracy knowledge, as well as verbal calculation and magnitude comparison. Thus, although patterning skills related to measures of general cognitive ability, patterning was a unique contributor to children’s general math and numeracy knowledge and specific math skills.

We call this asymmetry in how average ratings are updated endogenous crowd formation. Using computer simulations, we showed that it implies the emergence of a negative bias in average ratings.

We hypothesized that inhibition HIF-PHD by adaptaquin reduces hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in a neonatal mouse model. The pups were treated intraperitoneally immediately with adaptaquin after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and then every 24 h for 3 days. Adaptaquin treatment reduced infarction volume by an average of 26.3% at 72 h after HI compared to vehicle alone, and this reduction was more pronounced in males (34.8%) than in females (11.7%). The protection was also more pronounced in the cortex. The subcortical white matter injury as measured by tissue loss volume was reduced by 24.4% in the adaptaquin treatment group, and this reduction was also more pronounced in males (28.4%) than in females (18.9%). Cell death was decreased in the cortex as indicated by Fluoro-Jade labeling, but not in other brain regions with adaptaquin treatment. Furthermore, in the brain injury area, adaptaquin did not alter the number of cells positive for caspase-3 activation or translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor to the nuclei. Adaptaquin treatment increased glutathione peroxidase 4 mRNA expression in the cortex but had no impact on 3-nitrotyrosine, 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine, or malondialdehyde production. Hif1α mRNA expression increased after HI, and adaptaquin treatment also stimulated Hif1α mRNA expression, which was also more pronounced in males than in females. However, nuclear translocation of HIF1α protein was decreased after HI, and adaptaquin treatment had no influence on HIF1α expression in the nucleus. These findings demonstrate that adaptaquin treatment is neuroprotective, but the potential mechanisms need further investigation.

Our sample contained 105 effect sizes from 32 primary studies employing meaning-focused word-learning activities with 1,964 participants with typical cognitive functioning. The random-effects meta-analysis yielded a mean effect size of g = 1.05, reflecting generally large vocabulary gains from spoken input in meaning-focused activities. A meta-regression with three substantive and two methodological predictors also revealed that adult participants outperformed children in terms of word learning and that interactive learning tasks were more effective than noninteractive ones. Furthermore, learning scores were higher when measured with recognition than with recall tests. Methodologically, the use of a no-input control group seemed to protect against an overestimation of learning effects, evidenced by smaller effect sizes. Finally, whether a pretest–posttest design was used did not influence effect sizes. All data and the analysis script are publicly available.

This design tested whether providing L1 task-essential practice only (alongside a core treatment of L2 EI plus L2 practice) resulted in similar online and offline learning gains compared to the original study’s L1 EI plus L1 practice.

In Study 1, we used a time-capsule paradigm to show that                     individuals underestimate the extent to which rediscovering experiences from the                     past will be curiosity provoking and interesting in the future. In Studies 2 and                     3, we found that people are particularly likely to underestimate the pleasure of                     rediscovering ordinary, mundane experiences, as opposed to extraordinary                     experiences. Finally, Study 4 demonstrates that underestimating the pleasure of                     rediscovery leads to time-inconsistent choices: Individuals forgo opportunities                     to document the present but then prefer rediscovering those moments in the                     future to engaging in an alternative fun activity. Underestimating the value of                     rediscovery is linked to people’s erroneous faith in their memory of everyday                     events.

As this shift coincides with school entry, the extent to which it is driven by brain maturation or by exposure to formal schooling is unclear. In this longitudinal study, we followed 5-year-olds born close to the official cutoff date for entry into first grade and compared those who subsequently entered first grade that year with those who remained in kindergarten, which is more play oriented. The first graders made larger improvements in accuracy on an executive-function test over the year than did the kindergartners. In an independent functional MRI task, we found that the first graders, compared with the kindergartners, exhibited a greater increase in activation of right posterior parietal cortex, a region previously implicated in sustained attention; increased activation in this region was correlated with the improvement in accuracy.

The present study provides a series of striking demonstrations of behavior that is inconsistent with such an intuition. Four experiments showed that in certain conditions, participants could not report an attribute (e.g., letter identity) of a stimulus even when that attribute had been attended and had reached a full state of conscious awareness just prior to being questioned about it. We term this effect attribute amnesia, and it occurs when participants repeatedly locate a target using one attribute and are then unexpectedly asked to report that attribute. This discovery suggests that attention to and awareness of a stimulus attribute are insufficient to ensure its immediate reportability.

Since the orphan receptor GPR37 has been shown to modulate A2AR function in vivo, we aimed to test whether the A2AR-mediated sensitization of locomotor activity is GPR37-dependent and involves adaptations of synaptic plasticity. To this end, we administered a selective A2AR antagonist, SCH58261 (1 mg/kg, i.p.), daily for 14 days, and the locomotor sensitization, striatum-dependent cued learning, and corticostriatal synaptic plasticity (i.e., long-term depression) were compared in wild-type and GPR37?/? mice. Notably, GPR37 deletion promoted A2AR-associated locomotor sensitization but not striatum-dependent cued learning revealed upon chronic SCH58261 treatment of mice. Furthermore, chronic A2AR blockade potentiated striatal long-term depression in corticostriatal synapses of GPR37?/? but not of wild-type mice, thus correlating well with neurochemical alterations of the adenosinergic system. Overall, these results revealed the importance of GPR37 regulating A2AR-dependent locomotor sensitization and synaptic plasticity in the basal ganglia circuitry.

Under this model, a distinction is made between beliefs regarding the degree to which interoceptive signals are the object of attention and beliefs regarding one’s ability to perceive accurately interoceptive signals. This distinction is difficult to test, however, because of the paucity of measures designed to assess self-reported perception of one’s own interoceptive accuracy. This article therefore reports on the development of such a measure, the Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS). Use of this measure enables assessment of the proposed distinction between beliefs regarding attention to, and accuracy in perceiving, interoceptive signals. Across six studies, we report on the development of the IAS and, importantly, its relationship with measures of trait self-reported interoceptive attention, objective interoceptive accuracy, confidence in the accuracy of specific interoceptive percepts, and metacognition with respect to interoceptive accuracy. Results support the distinction between individual differences in perceived attention towards interoceptive information and the accuracy of interoceptive perception.",2020-01-01,2020-02-05T06:27:23Z,2020-02-05T06:27:33Z,2020-02-05T06:27:23Z,115-133,NA,1,73,NA,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TWH47QHV\Murphy et al. - 2020 - Testing the independence of self-reported interoce.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Interoception; interoceptive accuracy; interoceptive attention; interoceptive sensibility; self-report,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000468

Here, we focus on the stability metatrait, which reflects shared variance in conscientiousness, agreeableness, and (inversely) neuroticism. It has been hypothesized that stability manifests, in part, because of individual differences in central serotonergic functioning. We explored this possibility in a community sample (N = 441) using a multiverse analysis of (a) multi-informant five-factor-model traits and (b) stability as a predictor of individual differences in central serotonergic functioning. Differences in serotonergic functioning were assessed by indexing change in serum prolactin concentration following intravenous infusion of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Results were mixed, showing that trait neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, as well as the stability metatrait, were significantly associated with prolactin response but that these findings were contingent on a number of modeling decisions. Specifically, these effects were nonlinear, emerging most strongly for participants with the highest levels (or lowest, for neuroticism) of the component traits.",2019-10-01,2020-01-29T06:33:32Z,2020-01-29T06:33:44Z,2020-01-29T06:33:32Z,1413-1423,NA,10,30,NA,Psychol Sci,Neurobiological Functioning and the Personality-Trait Hierarchy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6NKNBBTS\Wright et al. - 2019 - Neurobiological Functioning and the Personality-Tr.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,structural equation modeling; stability; open data; personality traits; psychopharmacological challenge; serotonin,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000470

However, such work has almost exclusively investigated these questions in young adults. During the same period, much has been learned about adult personality trait development but with scant attention to the momentary processes that contribute to development. The current work connects these two topics, testing developmental questions about adult age differences and thus examining how age matters to personality processes. The study examines how four important situation characteristics are experienced in everyday life and how situations covary with Big Five trait-relevant behaviour (i.e. situation–behaviour contingencies). Two samples were collected (total N = 316), each assessing three age groups: young, middle-aged, and older adults. Using experience sampling method, participants completed reports four or five times per day across a representative period of daily life. Results suggested age differences in how situations are experienced on average, in the variability around these average situation experiences, and in situation–behaviour contingencies. The results therefore highlight that, across adulthood, age groups experience chronically different situations, differ in how much the situations they experience vary moment to moment, and differ in how much situation experience predicts their enactment of traits. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:40:14Z,2020-01-30T12:42:50Z,2020-01-30T12:40:14Z,279-297,NA,3,33,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MENLHJ8A\Noftle and Gust - 2019 - Age Differences Across Adulthood in Interpretation.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VELXP38W\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,personality development; experience sampling; Big Five personality traits; personality processes; situations,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000472

Participants (N = 143) between the ages of 5 and 25 years completed a laboratory measure of negative emotion differentiation in which they rated how much a series of aversive images made them feel angry, disgusted, sad, scared, and upset. Emotion-differentiation scores were computed using intraclass correlations. Emotion differentiation followed a nonlinear developmental trajectory: It fell from childhood to adolescence and rose from adolescence to adulthood. Mediation analyses suggested that an increased tendency to report feeling emotions one at a time explained elevated emotion differentiation in childhood. Importantly, two other mediators (intensity of emotional experiences and scale use) did not explain this developmental trend. Hence, low emotion differentiation in adolescence may arise because adolescents have little experience conceptualizing co-occurring emotions.",2018-08,2019-04-06T18:21:34Z,2019-04-06T18:21:49Z,2019-04-06T18:21:34Z,1346-1357,NA,8,29,NA,NA,The Nonlinear Development of Emotion Differentiation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZN6LYAP4\Nook e.a. - 2018 - The Nonlinear Development of Emotion Differentiati.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000474

In one condition, both targets were available, which gave the observer free choice of what to search for and allowed for proactive control. In the other condition, only one of the two targets was available, so that the choice was imposed, and a reactive mechanism would be required. No switch costs emerged when target choice was free, but switch costs emerged reliably when targets were imposed.

In an experiment with 447 participants, we examined whether sharing attention increased affiliation irrespective of the co-attended stimulus (the stimulus-independent hypothesis), or based on the co-attended stimulus (the stimulus-dependent hypothesis). The results substantiated the stimulus-dependent hypothesis, confirming that the effect of shared attention on affiliation depends on the stimulus under shared attention. More specifically, whereas belief-affirming messages under shared attention increased felt closeness to the co-attendee, belief-disaffirming and mixed messages under shared attention did not increase felt closeness to the co-attendee.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were demonstrated to play a crucial role in many diseases. To give a foundation for subsequent functional studies of lncRNAs in HIBD, we investigated the profiling of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) using neonatal HIBD rat model. Six neonatal rats were divided into sham-operated group (n = 3) and HIBD group (n = 3) randomly. Deep RNA sequencing was implemented to find out the meaningful lncRNAs and mRNAs. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate expressions of lncRNAs and mRNAs. The Gene Ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes a genomes (KEGG) database were used to predict functions of lncRNAs. A total of 328 differentially expressed lncRNAs (177 down-regulated vs 151 up-regulated) and 7157 differentially expressed mRNAs (2552 down-regulated vs 4605 up-regulated) were identified. The Quantitative real-time PCR results showed significant differential expressions of five lncRNAs and five mRNAs which were consistent with the RNA-Seq data. Gene ontology and KEGG analysis showed these lncRNAs and their expression-correlated mRNAs were closely related to the Janus tyrosine kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and more. The results of our study identified the characterization and expression profiles of lncRNAs in neonatal HIBD and may be a basis for further therapeutic research.

However, the underlying mechanism(s) responsible for degeneration remains elusive. Presently, using co-immunoprecipitation in HEK (Human embryonic kidney) 293 cells, we show that Pink1 endogenously interacts with FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51 or FKBP5), FKBP5 and directly phosphorylates FKBP5 at Serine in an in vitro kinase assay. Both FKBP5 and Pink1 have been previously associated with protein kinase B (AKT) regulation. We provide evidence using primary cortical cultured neurons from Pink1-deficient mice that Pink1 increases AKT phosphorylation at Serine 473 (Ser473) challenged by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and that over-expression of FKBP5 using an adeno-associated virus delivery system negatively regulates AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 in murine-cultured cortical neurons. Interestingly, FKBP5 over-expression promotes death in response to MPP+ in the absence of Pink1. Conversely, shRNA-mediated knockdown of FKBP5 in cultured cortical neurons is protective and this effect is reversed with inhibition of AKT signaling. In addition, shRNA down-regulation of PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) in Pink1 WT neurons increases neuronal survival, while down-regulation of PHLPP in Pink1 KO rescues neuronal death in response to MPP+. Finally, using co-immunoprecipitation, we show that FKBP5 interacts with the kinase AKT and phosphatase PHLPP. This interaction is increased in the absence of Pink1, both in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF) and in mouse brain tissue. Expression of kinase dead Pink1 (K219M) enhances FKBP5 interaction with both AKT and PHLPP. Overall, our results suggest a testable model by which Pink1 could regulate AKT through phosphorylation of FKBP5 and interaction of AKT with PHLPP. Our results suggest a potential mechanism by which PINK1-FKBP5 pathway contributes to neuronal death in PD.

At the same time, correlations between the IAT and criterion measures are often remarkably low. Developed within research using explicit measures of attitudes, the correspondence principle posits that measures should better predict criteria when there is a match in terms of the level of generality or specificity at which both are conceptualized (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977). As such, weak implicit-criterion correlations are to be expected when broad general implicit measures are used to predict highly specific criteria. Research using explicit measures of attitudes consistently supports the correspondence principle, but conceptual correspondence is rarely considered by researchers using implicit measures to predict behavior and other relevant criterion measures. In five experiments (total N = 4650), we provide the first direct evidence demonstrating the relevance of the correspondence principle to the predictive validity of the IAT and Single-Target IAT. That said, it is not the case that the IAT always predicts criteria better when correspondence is high. Inconsistency across the pattern of results suggests there is much more that remains to be understood about the relevance of the correspondence principle to the implicit-criterion relationship. Taken together, however, our findings suggest that conceptual correspondence often increases (and never decreases) the magnitude of implicit-criterion and implicit-explicit relationships. We provide a framework for future research necessary to establish when correspondence is more likely to increase the predictive validity of measures such as the IAT.",2020-01-01,2020-02-06T02:10:08Z,2020-02-07T00:18:18Z,2020-02-06T02:10:08Z,103898,NA,NA,86,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Measure what you are trying to predict,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AMLQQUGV\Irving and Smith - 2020 - Measure what you are trying to predict Applying t.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3233CJPY\S0022103119301386.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Implicit Association Test; Implicit attitudes; Correspondence principle; Predictive validity,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000481

We hypothesized that altered APP processing, because of augmented BACE activity, would affect the actions of direct and indirect BACE inhibitors. We therefore compared post-mitotic human neurons (LUHMES) with their BACE-overexpressing counterparts (BLUHMES). Although ?-cleavage of APP was strongly increased in BLUHMES, they produced less full-length and truncated amyloid beta (A?) than LUHMES. Moreover, low concentrations of BACE inhibitors decreased cellular BACE activity as expected, but increased A?1-40 levels. Several other approaches to modulate BACE activity led to a similar, apparently paradoxical, behavior. For instance, reduction in intracellular acidification by bepridil increased A? production in parallel with decreased BACE activity. In contrast to BLUHMES, the respective control cells (LUHMES or BLUHMES with catalytically inactive BACE) showed conventional pharmacological responses. Other non-canonical neurochemical responses (so-called ?rebound effects?) are well-documented for the A? pathway, especially for ?-secretase: a partial block of its activity leads to an increased A? secretion by some cell types. We therefore compared LUHMES and BLUHMES regarding rebound effects of ?-secretase inhibitors and found an A? rise in LUHMES but not in BLUHMES. Thus, different cellular factors are responsible for the ?-secretase- versus BACE-related A? rebound. We conclude that increased BACE activity, possibly accompanied by an altered cellular localization pattern, can dramatically influence A? generation in human neurons and affect pharmacological responses to secretase inhibitors.

Abnormal glutamatergic signalling within this network may play a role in aggression. However, disruptive behavior does not represent a homogeneous construct, but can be fractionated across several dimensions. Of particular interest, callous-unemotional (CU) traits have been shown to modulate the severity, neural and behavioural characterisation, and therapeutic outcomes of disruptive behaviour disorders (DBDs) and aggression. Further, individuals showing disruptive behavior differ to the extent that they engage in subtypes of aggression (i.e., proactive [PA] and reactive aggression [RA]) which may also represent distinct therapeutic targets. Here we investigated how glutamate signalling within the fronto-amygdala-striatal circuitry was altered along these dimensions in youths showing disruptive behavior (n = 140) and typically developing controls (TD, n = 93) within the age-range of 8–18 years. We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), striatum, amygdala and insula and associated glutamate concentrations with continuous measures of aggression and CU-traits using linear mixed-effects models. We found evidence of a dissociation for the different measures and glutamate concentrations. CU traits were associated with increased ACC glutamate (‘callousness’: b = .19, t (108) = 2.63, p = .01, r = .25; ‘uncaring’: b = .18, t (108) = 2.59, p = .011, r = .24) while PA was associated with decreased striatal glutamate concentration (b = −.23, t (28) = -3.02, p = .005, r = .50). These findings suggest dissociable correlates of CU traits and PA in DBDs, and indicate that the ACC and striatal glutamate may represent novel pharmacological targets in treating these different aspects.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:10:48Z,2020-01-30T12:02:07Z,2020-01-30T08:10:48Z,135-146,NA,NA,121,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QWQ7A564\Craig et al. - 2019 - Distinct associations between fronto-striatal glut.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6FJED2HQ\S0010945219303065.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Aggression; Glutamate; Anterior cingulate cortex; Callous unemotional traits; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000485

These studies have also found substantial inter?individual differences in the intra?individual development of self?esteem. In the current study, we examined whether this variation in change could be attributed to underlying latent classes of individuals following different trajectories of self?esteem development over time. By applying general growth mixture modelling to data from the representative German pairfam study (N?=?12?377), four latent classes of self?esteem development across five years were extracted. Based on their mean levels, trajectories, and variability, individuals in the latent classes could be described as having (a) constant and stable high self?esteem (29.00% of the sample), (b) constant but variable moderate self?esteem (31.69%), (c) increasing and stabilizing self?esteem (15.13%), and (d) decreasing and variable self?esteem (24.18%). Furthermore, these latent classes differed in accordance with findings of prior research on self?rated, partner?rated, and objective correlates of the domains of health and well?being, partner relationships, and occupational status. Thus, the current study shows that inter?individual variation in intra?individual change in self?esteem is not random but reflects specific individual trajectories, or pathways, of self?esteem.

HIV impairs neuronal function through indirect mechanisms mainly mediated by inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic viral proteins, such as the envelope protein gp120. HIV gp120 elicits a neuroinflammatory response that potentiates NMDA receptor function and induces the loss of excitatory synapses. How gp120 influences neuronal inhibition remains unknown. In this study, we expressed a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged recombinant antibody-like protein that binds to the post-synaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin to label inhibitory synapses in living neurons. Treatment with 600 pM gp120 for 24 h increased the number of labeled inhibitory synapses. HIV gp120 evoked the release of interleukin-1? (IL-1?) from microglia to activate IL-1 receptors on neurons. Subsequent activation of the tyrosine kinase Src and GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors increased the number of inhibitory synapses via a process that required protein synthesis. In naïve cultures, inhibition of neuronal p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) increased the number of inhibitory synapses suggesting that p38 MAPK produces a basal suppression of inhibitory synapses that is overcome in the presence of gp120. Direct activation of a mutant form of p38 MAPK expressed in neurons mimicked basal suppression of inhibitory synapses. This study shows for the first time that gp120-induced neuroinflammation increases the number of inhibitory synapses and that this increase overcomes a basal suppression of synaptic inhibition. Increased inhibition may be an adaptive mechanism enabling neurons to counteract excess excitatory input in order to maintain network homeostasis.

However, given its links to self-control—itself a necessary factor for repaying debts—the possibility arises that gratitude might enhance other virtues unrelated to exchange that depend on an ability to resist temptation. Here, we examined gratitude’s ability to function as a “parent” virtue by focusing on its ability to reduce cheating. Using real-time behavior-based measures of cheating, we demonstrated that gratitude, as opposed to neutrality and the more general positive emotional state of happiness, reduces cheating in both a controlled laboratory setting (N = 156) and a more anonymous online setting (N = 141). This finding suggests that not all moral qualities need to be studied in silos but, rather, that hierarchies exist wherein certain virtues might give rise to seemingly unrelated others.",2019-07-01,2020-01-29T06:05:39Z,2020-01-29T06:05:54Z,2020-01-29T06:05:38Z,979-988,NA,7,30,NA,Psychol Sci,The Grateful Don’t Cheat,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3L3R4BZL\DeSteno et al. - 2019 - The Grateful Don’t Cheat Gratitude as a Fount of .pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,emotion; cheating; open data; preregistered; gratitude; moral virtue,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000491

The theoretically predicted locations of the different narcissism constructs within the CPM space were empirically verified using the structural summary method. We found that grandiose, vulnerable, and communal narcissism can be meaningfully located within the CPM, while the status of collective narcissism remains unclear.

These patterns may be a result of marked dietary differences between captive and wild settings and associated impacts on the gut microbiome. However, given that most existing studies target NHP dietary specialists, it is unclear if captive environments have distinct impacts on the gut microbiome of NHPs with different dietary niches. To begin to examine this question, we used 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequences to compare the gut microbiomes of five NHP genera categorized either as folivores (Alouatta, Colobus) or non-folivores (Cercopithecus, Gorilla, Pan) sampled both in captivity and in the wild. Though captivity affected the gut microbiomes of all NHPs in this study, the effects were largest in folivorous NHPs. Shifts in gut microbial diversity and in the relative abundances of fiber-degrading microbial taxa suggest that these findings are driven by marked dietary shifts for folivorous NHPs in captive settings. We propose that zoos and other captive care institutions consider including more natural browse in folivorous NHP diets and regularly bank fecal samples to further explore the relationship between NHP diet, the gut microbiome, and health outcomes.",2019,2020-01-29T03:44:41Z,2020-01-29T03:45:06Z,2020-01-29T03:44:41Z,e23061,NA,12,81,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CBLCBW8X\Frankel et al. - 2019 - The effect of captivity on the primate gut microbi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V2X656YP\ajp.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,diet; captivity; folivore; gut microbiome,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000493

Over the last decade or so, a number of projects have contributed to the rescue of some of these data. Here we provide a summary of a survey we have undertaken of several meteorological and climate data rescue projects, in order to identify the needs of climate data rescue services. To make these efforts more sustainable, additional integrated activities are needed. We argue that meteorological and climate data rescue must be seen as a continuous, coordinated long-term effort. Technical developments (e.g. data assimilation), new scientific questions (e.g. process understanding of extreme events) and new social (e.g. risk assessment, health) or economic (e.g. new renewable energy sources, agriculture and forestry, tourism, infrastructure, etc.) services are highlighting the immense value of data previously neglected or never considered. This continuous effort is currently undertaken by projects of various sizes, structure, funding and staffing, as well as by dedicated programmes, ranging from those within many national weather services down to ?grassroots? initiatives. These activities are often not sufficiently coordinated, staffed, or funded at an international level and will benefit considerably from climate data rescue services being established within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) (https://climate.copernicus.eu/).

First, we demonstrated that frontal executive-control areas were more engaged for more difficult decisions and that this effect was enhanced for high-magnitude rewards. Second, we showed that increased hunger, which is associated with lower self-control, reduced the magnitude effect. Third, we tested an intervention designed to increase self-control and showed that it reduced the magnitude effect.

Participants consistently responded fastest to WM probes at locations of self-associated colors (Experiments 1–4). This self-bias was driven not by differential exogenous attention during encoding or retrieval (Experiments 1 and 2) but by internal attentional prioritization of self-related representations during WM maintenance (Experiment 3).

Previous research has challenged this claim by showing that the EC effect in facial stimuli is disrupted when a single feature of a face is altered. As the external validity of research paradigms is vital when generalizing findings from an experiment to the social world, the present research reconsiders this previous work in three experiments. Using faces as conditioned stimuli, we demonstrate that neither changes in viewing angle (Experiments 1 and 2), nor changes in features of the conditioned face (Experiment 3) disrupt the EC effect. The present experiments thus demonstrate that attitude acquisition by means of EC procedures generalizes to novel instances of the conditioned stimulus, signifying the adaptive value of EC effects in preparing behavior.

Mlc1-over-expressing mice represent an animal model of early-onset leukoencephalopathy, which manifests as astrocytic swelling followed by myelin membrane splitting in the white matter. It has been previously reported that Mlc1 is highly expressed in Bergmann glia, while the cerebellar phenotypes of Mlc1-over-expressing mouse have not been characterized. Here, we examined the cerebellum of Mlc1-over-expressing mouse and found that the distribution of Bergmann glia (BG) was normally compacted along the Purkinje cell (PC) layer until postnatal day 10 (P10), while most BG were dispersed throughout the molecular layer by P28. Ectopic BG were poorly wrapped around somatodendritic elements of PCs and exhibited reduced expression of the glutamate transporter glutamate-aspartate transporter. Extraordinarily slow and small climbing fiber (CF)-mediated excitatory post-synaptic currents, which are known to be elicited under accelerated glutamate spillover, emerged at P20-P28 when BG ectopia was severe, but not at P9-P12 when ectopia was mild. Furthermore, maturation of CF wiring, which translocates the site of innervation from somata to proximal dendrites, was also impaired. Manipulations that restricted the Mlc1-over-expressing period successfully generated mice with and without BG ectopia, depending on the over-expressing period. Together, these findings suggest that there is a critical time window for mechanisms that promote the positioning of BG in the PC layer. Once normal positioning of BG is affected, the differentiation of BG is impaired, leading to insufficient glial wrapping, exacerbated glutamate spillover, and aberrant synaptic wiring in PCs.

Thirty-eight Korean learners of English read two texts under conditions that required more or less careful reading.

For the condition expected to elicit less careful reading, each paragraph was split into two sections. While reading the texts, the participants’ eye movements were recorded. Eleven students were further invited to participate in stimulated recall protocols.

By using objective measurements of speakers’ acoustic cues and controlling for baseline cue levels, we were able to precisely capture the relationship between acoustic cues and hierarchical rank, as well as the covariation among the cues. In Experiment 1, analyses controlling for speakers’ baseline cue levels found that the voices of individuals in the high-rank condition were higher in pitch and loudness variability but lower in pitch variability, compared with the voices of individuals in the low-rank condition.

However, most arguments come from stimulus–response compatibility paradigms, raising the issue of the automaticity of affordance effects. Action priming paradigms overcome this issue but show less reliable results, possibly because affordance effects are moderated by additional factors. The present study aimed to assess whether affordance effects highlighted in action priming paradigms could be affected by object category (manufactured or natural). A total of 24 young adults performed a semantic categorisation task on natural and manufactured target objects presented after neutral (non-grasping hand postures) or action (congruent power or precision grips) primes. Results revealed a modulation of action priming effects as a function of object category. Object semantic categorisation was faster after action than neutral primes, but only for manufactured objects. Results suggest that natural and manufactured objects evoke distinct types of affordances and that action priming paradigms favour the evocation of functional affordances during object semantic categorisation. This finding fuels the debate on the nature of the motor information evoked by visual objects.",2019-12-01,2020-02-05T06:26:10Z,2020-02-05T06:26:20Z,2020-02-05T06:26:10Z,2801-2806,NA,12,72,NA,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,Do manufactured and natural objects evoke similar motor information?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MTWETAEW\Godard et al. - 2019 - Do manufactured and natural objects evoke similar .pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,priming; Embodied cognition; action representations; object concepts; semantic categorisation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000504

These were intermixed with an equal number of correct sentences for the purpose of the grammaticality judgment task. In a laboratory experiment (N = 57) and an online experiment (N = 94), we found that ungrammatical decisions were harder to make when the ungrammatical sequence originated from a grammatically correct base sequence.

Discriminating between the two is key to every social encounter. We propose that humans turn to internal information, namely the self, when judging the trustworthiness of others. Simulating how oneself would behave in situations that involve trust helps to predict how a counterpart may behave. Importantly, using the same self as a basis for judgments about others may result in diverging outcomes, depending on how the information is processed. If a judge focuses on similarities between the self and the target person, the judge expects the counterpart to act alike. However, if a judge focuses on differences, the target is expected to behave in ways opposite to the self. In Study 1, natural variations in self-ascribed levels of trustworthiness correlate positively with expectations of a target person's trustworthiness. Inducing a similarity-focus increases this correlation as compared to a difference-focus. Interestingly, this effect holds even if information speaks to the target's trustworthiness. In manipulating the perception of the participants' own trustworthiness as well as the processing focus, Studies 2–4 demonstrate that when individuals focus on similarities, those who perceive themselves as highly (vs. less) trustworthy perceive others as similarly highly (less) trustworthy. However, when they focus on differences, the reverse pattern tends to occur. These effects hold for trust judgments (Study 2–3) and trust behavior in an economic game (Study 4). Together, these findings demonstrate that trust involves egocentric inferences that are flexible enough to adjust for basic social relations.",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:47:32Z,2020-02-10T11:44:14Z,2020-02-06T01:47:32Z,103820,NA,NA,84,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RZKJ7Q4M\Posten and Mussweiler - 2019 - Egocentric foundations of trust.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XXSE6NKY\S0022103118308886.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Trust; Economic decisions; Egocentrism; Judgment; Similarity,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000512

They demonstrated that after being told to associate three identities (self, friend, stranger) with three arbitrary stimuli (geometrical shapes), participants were faster in a perceptual matching task to recognise matching pairs of self-associated shape with self-label, than respective friend or stranger-related pairings. They interpreted this as evidence that a brief self-association is sufficient to facilitate processing of previously neutral stimuli. However, in the matching trials of the self-prioritization task, participants are processing not only self-associated arbitrary stimuli but also familiar verbal labels with an established meaning. Therefore, the self-advantage may be caused by familiarity of the labels, rather than self-association of the shapes. To test whether self-prioritization can be elicited in a task employing exclusively neutral stimuli, we asked participants to associate avatar faces with three identities (self, name of best friend, and stranger) and replaced labels with unfamiliar abstract symbols that were associated to the words (you, friend, stranger) before the actual experiment started.

However, the cognitive basis of this data-gathering tendency remains unclear. Suggested theories include that delusion-prone individuals gather less data because they (a) misjudge the information value of evidence, (b) find data gathering more taxing than do controls, or (c) make noisier decisions than controls. In the present study we developed a novel, incentivized, nonserial data-gathering task to tease apart these alternatives. Higher delusion-proneness was associated with gathering less information on this task, even when accounting for gender, risk aversion, and intelligence. Our findings suggest that misjudging the information value of evidence contributes substantially to the “jumping to conclusions” bias and that neither higher subjective costs nor noisy decision making can fully account for it.",2017-07-01,2018-03-23T02:44:42Z,2018-03-23T02:44:48Z,2018-03-23T02:44:42Z,718-725,NA,4,5,NA,Clinical Psychological Science,Why Do Delusion-Prone Individuals “Jump to Conclusions”?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PQJLRHEK\Leer et al. - 2017 - Why Do Delusion-Prone Individuals “Jump to Conclus.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000516

First-year students (N = 658) were recruited before beginning university in August and contacted again in October, January, and April.

In their Experiment 1, participants descrambled sets of words to form sentences. In one condition, 80% of the descrambled sentences described hostile behaviors, and in another condition, 20% described hostile behaviors. Following the descrambling task, all participants read a vignette about a man named Donald who behaved in an ambiguously hostile manner and then rated him on a set of personality traits. Next, participants rated the hostility of various ambiguously hostile behaviors (all ratings on scales from 0 to 10). Participants who descrambled mostly hostile sentences rated Donald and the ambiguous behaviors as approximately 3 scale points more hostile than did those who descrambled mostly neutral sentences. This Registered Replication Report describes the results of 26 independent replications (N = 7,373 in the total sample; k = 22 labs and N = 5,610 in the primary analyses) of Srull and Wyer’s Experiment 1, each of which followed a preregistered and vetted protocol. A random-effects meta-analysis showed that the protagonist was seen as 0.08 scale points more hostile when participants were primed with 80% hostile sentences than when they were primed with 20% hostile sentences (95% confidence interval, CI = [0.004, 0.16]). The ambiguously hostile behaviors were seen as 0.08 points less hostile when participants were primed with 80% hostile sentences than when they were primed with 20% hostile sentences (95% CI = [−0.18, 0.01]).

In the present experiments (n = 80 and n = 79), we provided or did not provide participants with the opportunity to recommend a punishment for an in-group or an out-group deviant. We also measured in-group identification before and after exposure to deviant behavior and after judgment. The results show that participants first disidentified from the in-group but, when presented with an opportunity to judge the deviant, also derogated.

But what are the principle’s origins, and how did it become such a fixture? Three studies investigated intuitions about linear order in the Yupno, members of a culture of Papua New Guinea that lacks conventional representations involving ordered lines, and in U.S. undergraduates. Presented with cards representing differing sizes and numerosities, both groups arranged them using linear order or sometimes spatial grouping, a competing principle. But whereas the U.S. participants produced ordered lines in all tasks, strongly favoring a left-to-right format, the Yupno produced them less consistently, and with variable orientations. Conventional linear representations are thus not necessary to spark the intuition of linear order—which may have other experiential sources—but they nonetheless regiment when and how the principle is used.",2017-05-01,2018-03-20T00:34:05Z,2018-03-20T00:34:16Z,2018-03-20T00:34:04Z,599-608,NA,5,28,NA,Psychol Sci,Where Does the Ordered Line Come From?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Y6Q4PDYH\Cooperrider et al. - 2017 - Where Does the Ordered Line Come From Evidence Fr.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000526

About 97% of the series are publicly available in a common format, while the remaining 3% can be obtained from the original data providers. Unlike other similar products, duplicates have been removed without blending of series, which simplifies data traceability and improves the temporal homogeneity of the individual series at the cost of a smaller average length. Residual artificial signals (breakpoints) in the series caused by station relocations, changes in instrumentation, etc., have been detected by means of the combination of four breakpoint detection tests, four variables and three temporal aggregations. The combined results give not only the most probable position of the breakpoints, but also a measure of their likelihood. The reliability of the detection was estimated for each year of each target series, based on the number of reference series and on their correlation with the target series. Moreover, its general performance was evaluated through a benchmark of synthetic series.

Analyses of two large data sets gathered from MTurk (Sample 1: N = 2,692; Sample 2: N = 2,354) revealed two major findings: First, failing to screen for inattentive and fake respondents inflates the rates of major depression artificially and significantly (by 18.5%–27.5%). Second, after cleaning the data sets, depression in MTurk is still 1.6 to 3.6 times higher than general population estimates. Approximately half of this difference can be attributed to differences in the composition of MTurk samples and the general population (i.e., sociodemographics, health, and physical activity lifestyle).

These comparisons generally suggest poor representation. We argue here that this common design is unlikely to effectively evaluate representation because responses to survey questions differ in important aspects from voting in legislatures. Measurement error and construct validity undermine the comparison. Three survey experiments show that providing partisan and nonpartisan information readily available to legislators materially changes respondents' expressed preferences on roll-call votes. With information, expressed policy positions are both less centrist and more closely matched to legislator behavior in their preferred party. Respondents also appear aware of their own lack of knowledge in evaluating roll-call policy votes. The treatment effect of information decreases in confidence judging policy in that area.

Because humans appear to use social groups as units to explain social activities, we proposed that a socially defined group, according to social interaction information, would also be a possible object of attentional selection. This hypothesis was examined using displays with and without handshaking interactions. Results demonstrated that object-based attention, which was measured by an object-specific attentional advantage (i.e., shorter response times to targets on a single object), was extended to two hands performing a handshake but not to hands that did not perform meaningful social interactions, even when they did perform handshake-like actions. This finding cannot be attributed to the familiarity of the frequent co-occurrence of two handshaking hands. Hence, object-based attention can select a grouped object whose parts are connected within a meaningful social interaction.

We examined the impact of the causal centrality of a feature, a key determinant of the extent to which a feature defines a concept, on judgments of identity continuity.

This string of fluorescent puncta was impaired in wings of Innexin 2 (Inx2) mutant flies; although it is unclear whether the Innexin proteins act at the level of the wing imaginal disc, adult wing and/or at both levels.

Typical adults can do this with covert spatial attention: prioritizing particular visual field locations even without moving the eyes. Deficits of covert spatial attention have been implicated in developmental dyslexia, a specific reading disability. Previous studies of children with dyslexia, however, have been complicated by group differences in overall task ability that are difficult to distinguish from selective spatial attention. Here, we used a single-fixation visual search task to estimate orientation discrimination thresholds with and without an informative spatial cue in a large sample (N = 123) of people ranging in age from 5 to 70 years and with a wide range of reading abilities. We assessed the efficiency of attentional selection via the cueing effect: the difference in log thresholds with and without the spatial cue. Across our whole sample, both absolute thresholds and the cueing effect gradually improved throughout childhood and adolescence. Compared to typical readers, individuals with dyslexia had higher thresholds (worse orientation discrimination) as well as smaller cueing effects (weaker attentional selection). Those differences in dyslexia were especially pronounced prior to age 20, when basic visual function is still maturing.

So far, however, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Specifically, it is unclear whether social norms can lead to a persistent perceptual bias. Using a diffusion model analysis, we extended the social reinforcement account (social norms work via mechanisms of reinforcement learning). Thereby, our study is the first to disentangle whether the effect of social norms on perceptual decision-making is due to altering the uptake of sensory information (i.e., a perceptual bias) or due to shifting the decision criteria (i.e., a judgmental bias). Across two experiments, our results consistently show that learning of social norms shapes perceptual decision-making due to a lasting perceptual bias towards norm-congruent sensory information. This finding was not moderated by the sociality of the norm, that is, by how strongly norms were linked to group membership. Complementary to current psychological models, our results suggest that social norms might become and remain internalized because individuals are chronically biased towards norm-congruent information.",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:48:47Z,2020-02-10T11:43:27Z,2020-02-06T01:48:47Z,103801,NA,NA,84,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Learning of social norms can lead to a persistent perceptual bias,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VRBPJIX4\Germar and Mojzisch - 2019 - Learning of social norms can lead to a persistent .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A4GWCF2F\S0022103118304347.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Social norms; Social influence; Diffusion model; Perceptual decision-making,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000535

We shed new light on heterogeneity in economic elites' political preferences, arguing that economic elites from an industry can share distinctive preferences due in part to sharing distinctive predispositions. Consequently, how increases in economic elites' influence affect inequality depends on which industry's elites are gaining influence and which policy issues are at stake. We demonstrate our argument with four original surveys, including the two largest political surveys of American economic elites to date: one of technology entrepreneurs—whose influence is burgeoning—and another of campaign donors. We show that technology entrepreneurs support liberal redistributive, social, and globalistic policies but conservative regulatory policies—a bundle of preferences rare among other economic elites.

The current research will provide deeper insight into the stigmatization and well-being of singles by understanding the ‘group-y’ nature of singles, and how identification with groups and perceptions of groups map onto discrimination and prejudice. Study 1 will examine the extent to which singles identify as part of a group. Participants will be assigned a novel minimal group identity and then complete measures of group identification for four distinct group memberships (e.g., minimal group, relationship status, sexual orientation, nationality). We hypothesize that single participants' identification with their single group will be lower compared to other identities—including partnered people—although a smaller subset of singles may identify strongly with other singles. We also hypothesize that singles in general will perceive less discrimination towards singles relative to other aspects of their identity. In contrast, Study 2 will examine the extent to which singles are perceived as a group and the extent to which they are perceived as being responsible for their group membership. Participants will complete measures of entitativity and perceptions of responsibility for similar out-group identities as in Study 1 (e.g., single people or people in romantic relationships, sexual or asexual people, etc.). We hypothesize that singles will be rated lower in entitativity than people in romantic relationships and other groups, yet rated higher in responsibility than other groups. Moreover, we hypothesize that prejudice towards singles will be more acceptable than prejudice towards other groups. Throughout both studies, we will use Bayesian sequential analyses in order to efficiently acquire evidence in favor or against our experimental hypotheses.

The effect of mHtt could be mediated by transcriptional alterations, by direct interaction with mitochondria, or by both. In the present study, we tested a hypothesis that mHtt directly damages mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, we applied brain cytosolic fraction from YAC128 mice, containing mHtt, to brain non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria from wild-type mice and assessed mitochondrial respiration with a Clark-type oxygen electrode, membrane potential and Ca2+ uptake capacity with tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+)- and Ca2+-sensitive electrodes, respectively, and, reactive oxygen species production with Amplex Red assay. The amount of mHtt bound to mitochondria following incubation with mHtt-containing cytosolic fraction was greater than the amount of mHtt bound to brain mitochondria isolated from YAC128 mice. Despite mHtt binding to wild-type mitochondria, no abnormalities in mitochondrial functions were detected. This is consistent with our previous results demonstrating the lack of defects in brain mitochondria isolated from R6/2 and YAC128 mice. This, however, could be because of partial loss of mitochondrially bound mHtt during the isolation procedure. Consequently, we increased the amount of mitochondrially bound mHtt by incubating brain non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria isolated from YAC128 mice with mHtt-containing cytosolic fraction. Despite the enrichment of YAC128 brain mitochondria with mHtt, mitochondrial functions (respiration, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, Ca2+ uptake capacity) remained unchanged. Overall, our results suggest that mHtt does not directly impair mitochondrial functions, arguing against the involvement of this mechanism in HD pathogenesis.

Two biases were suggested to underlie NGA: (1) negative response bias, whereby a novel object is perceived as novel, but forced to make a dichotomous good/bad decision, a responder has a strategy to classify it as bad; (2) negative weighting-of-similarity bias, whereby a novel object seems more similar to negative learned objects than to positive learned objects. We hypothesized that adding a third response alternative, “cannot be evaluated”, to the good/bad response alternatives commonly used in the BeanFest paradigm would reduce negative response bias but not negative weighting-of-similarity. As predicted, the new response alternative was used more as similarity to learned stimuli decreased. Also as predicted, NGA, although still significant, was lower in the 3-alternatives condition. Interestingly, extent of reduction in NGA due to adding the new response alternative did not vary as a function of stimulus type, and was not particularly strong for stimuli very dissimilar to any learned stimuli. These results confirm that NGA is indeed partly due to response bias. They additionally suggest that increased NGA with decreasing similarity to learned stimuli cannot be attributed solely to negative response bias. Thus, avoidance of new, unfamiliar objects does not reflect only strategic caution, but rather reflects to a large extent a naïve-realistic belief that they are negative.",2019-11-01,2020-02-06T01:59:56Z,2020-02-10T04:03:58Z,2020-02-06T01:59:56Z,103887,NA,NA,85,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KN2YEMV9\Ram and Liberman - 2019 - The relative contribution of response bias and wei.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NWC79Q8N\S0022103118300532.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Attitude generalization; Negative generalization asymmetry; Response bias; Weighting-of-similarity bias,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000544

I substantiate this claim by examining how patronage networks shape economic performance of local governments in China. Using an original city–level panel data set between 2000 and 2011, and a new method that identifies patronage ties based on past promotions, I show that city leaders with informal ties to the incumbent provincial leaders deliver significantly faster economic growth than those without.

A wide range of both internally and externally directed behavioral strategies may serve to protect well-being among caregivers. Specifically, primary control strategies involve direct attempts to change one’s current situation, while secondary control strategies are attempts to inwardly adjust cognitions to align with the current situation. This study examined the use of multiple primary and secondary control strategies among familial caregivers (n = 110), as well as their associations with several indices of psychological well-being. Results showed that the most common primary and secondary control strategies, namely task persistence and positive reappraisal, were used with approximately equal frequency. Furthermore, the specific strategy of positive reappraisal seemed to bolster psychological well-being among caregivers.

Although most Americans indicate that they would prefer greater equality, redistributive policies aimed at reducing inequality are frequently unpopular. Traditional accounts posit that attitudes toward redistribution are driven by economic self-interest or ideological principles. From a social psychological perspective, however, we expected that subjective comparisons with other people may be a more relevant basis for self-interest than is material wealth. We hypothesized that participants would support redistribution more when they felt low than when they felt high in subjective status, even when actual resources and self-interest were held constant. Moreover, we predicted that people would legitimize these shifts in policy attitudes by appealing selectively to ideological principles concerning fairness.

In three experiments, participants studied emotionally negative and neutral images that varied in luminance and color saturation, and they reconstructed the visual salience of each image in a subsequent test. Results revealed, unexpectedly, that memories were recollected as less visually salient than they were encoded, demonstrating a novel memory-fading effect, whereas negative emotion increased subjective memory vividness and the precision with which visual features were encoded. Finally, memory vividness tracked both the precision and remembered salience (bias) of visual information.

In 5 studies, however, we found that implicit impressions of untrustworthy faces can be effectively updated by learning new, counterattitudinal behavioral information under certain conditions. We showed that face-based implicit impressions were rapidly updated regardless of the degree of untrustworthiness in the face (Study 1), but only when new, propositional information was extreme and diagnostic (Study 2). Successful updating of untrustworthy faces occurred even under low cognitive capacity (Studies 3A and 3B), suggesting efficient processing of inconsistent information. In addition, expanding the conditions under which updating can emerge, we also found that face-based implicit impressions of trustworthiness can be updated using valenced information (positive, negative) rather than just trustworthy-specific counterevidence (Study 4). We discuss the implications of these findings for whether facial cues of untrustworthiness are surmountable in person perception, how people learn about the trustworthiness of others, and the updating of implicit impressions more generally.",2020-01-01,2020-02-06T02:07:37Z,2020-02-07T00:39:08Z,2020-02-06T02:07:36Z,103888,NA,NA,86,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Beware a dishonest face?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZJBXDUTV\Shen et al. - 2020 - Beware a dishonest face Updating face-based impl.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3KGREESX\S0022103118308503.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Implicit evaluation; Trustworthiness; Updating; Face; Attitude; Diagnosticity,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000549

Participants from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom played iterated Trust Games with trustworthy and untrustworthy members of both ingroups and outgroups. We show that the influence of group membership on trust decisions depended on the valence of the interactions with individual group members. When interacting with trustworthy partners, people displayed outgroup favouritism throughout the game, investing higher in outgroup members than ingroup members. However, for untrustworthy partners, initial outgroup favouritism disappeared, and ingroup and outgroup members were equally distrusted by the end of the game.

Piaget suggested that children need to learn the physical rules that govern their environment before they can represent abstract concepts such as number and time. Thus, learning how objects move in space and time may underpin the development of related abstract representations (i.e., mathematics). To test this hypothesis, we captured objective measures of interceptive timing in 309 primary school children (5–11 years old), alongside scores for general motor skill and national standardized academic attainment. Bayesian estimation showed that interceptive timing (but not general motor capability) uniquely predicted mathematical ability even after we controlled for age, reading, and writing attainment.

In the present research, we examined associations among cultural stigma (i.e., objective devaluation of one’s stigmatized status), emotion regulation deficits, and poor mental health. In Study 1, we created an index of cultural stigma by asking members of the general public and stigma experts to indicate desired social distance toward 93 stigmatized attributes. In Study 2, emotion regulation deficits mediated the association between cultural stigma and adverse mental health outcomes, including depressive symptoms and alcohol use problems, among individuals endorsing diverse stigmatized identities. The indirect effect of cultural stigma, via emotion regulation, on these outcomes was stronger among those reporting more life stress. These findings highlight the adverse impact of cultural stigma on mental health and its role in potentiating stigmatized individuals’ susceptibility to general life stress.",2018-07-01,2019-03-20T13:49:48Z,2019-03-20T13:49:56Z,2019-03-20T13:49:48Z,590-600,NA,4,6,NA,Clinical Psychological Science,Does Getting Stigma Under the Skin Make It Thinner?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9UEAYRUL\Burton e.a. - 2018 - Does Getting Stigma Under the Skin Make It Thinner.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000555

However, most listeners solve this problem effortlessly. In the present experiment, we demonstrated that part of the solution lies in predicting upcoming speech sounds and that predictions are modulated by high-level expectations about the current sound. Participants heard isolated fricatives (e.g., “s,” “sh”) and predicted the upcoming vowel. Accuracy was above chance, which suggests that fine-grained detail in the signal can be used for prediction. A second group performed the same task but also saw a still face and a letter corresponding to the fricative. This group performed markedly better, which suggests that high-level knowledge modulates prediction by helping listeners form expectations about what the fricative should have sounded like. This suggests a form of data explanation operating in speech perception: Listeners account for variance due to their knowledge of the talker and current phoneme, and they use what is left over to make more accurate predictions about the next sound.",2016-01-01,2018-03-20T01:51:02Z,2018-03-20T01:51:10Z,2018-03-20T01:51:02Z,43-52,NA,1,27,NA,Psychol Sci,What Comes After /f/?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IWL8MLGG\McMurray and Jongman - 2016 - What Comes After f Prediction in Speech Derives.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000556

Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p < .05), we found that 15 (54%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p < .0001), 14 (50%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen’s ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small (< 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57%), and 9 effects (32%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively).

We found that the presence of a beard increased the speed and accuracy with which participants recognized displays of anger but not happiness (Experiment 1, N = 219). This effect was not due to negative evaluations shared by beardedness and anger or to negative stereotypes associated with beardedness, as beards did not facilitate recognition of another negative expression, sadness (Experiment 2, N = 90), and beards increased the rated prosociality of happy faces in addition to the rated masculinity and aggressiveness of angry faces (Experiment 3, N = 445).

Although the implications of this                     phenomenon have been widely studied, its underlying cause remains undetermined.

One of the main candidate as the cortical source of this ERP component is the inferior intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Moreover, previous neuroimaging studies put forth evidence for the presence of a distributed VWM network involving also prefrontal areas and in particular the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Nonetheless, the understanding of the functional role of ACC is still debated. We recorded the high-density EEG in 20 healthy participants undergoing a VWM and a control task. Explorative cluster-based permutation statistics confirmed the posterior memory load dependent CDA modulation, but also identified an additional anterior cluster of electrodes whose amplitude was modulated by memory load. The source reconstruction revealed a memory load dependent activation in the IPS but also in the ACC, suggesting that these two areas might be nodes of a fronto-parietal circuit underlying VWM maintenance. Crucially, parietal and prefrontal areas showed a temporal dissociation, since IPS was more engaged in the early phase of visual information storage while the ACC was more active during the late phase. This pattern suggests a functional dissociation between the parietal cortex, which is involved in encoding and storage of information, and prefrontal areas, subserving cognitive control processes, including the boosting and protection of information from decay. Remarkably, the connection strength between IPS and ACC predicted the individual number of items held in memory.

In part, this is because product proliferation makes the introduction of close substitutes comparatively less profitable; in part, it is because the strategy conveys a threat of retaliation to potential imitators. Yet this threat is only credible if the proliferator has high costs of exit from the occupied region of space. We hypothesize that complexity, as a property of product (sub)spaces, generates exit costs for the proliferator and increases the deterrent power of its strategy. We test this hypothesis by studying sequential product introductions in the U.S. recording industry, 2004–2014. Managerial Summary Differentiated-product markets are often concentrated in the hands of a few dominant organizations, which strive to keep on equal footing by offering similar products. In these markets, a product proliferation strategy can help one of the dominant incumbents claim a particular submarket as its territory. Investing heavily in that submarket communicates a threat that the proliferator will retaliate against invaders to protect these investments. However, this threat is not credible enough to deter rivals unless the occupied submarket is sufficiently complex in terms of product attributes, as precisely this kind of complexity makes it harder for proliferators to back down if challenged. We find evidence of this mechanism in an analysis of product competition among major record companies and discuss implications for strategic decision-making.

We tested whether physical experience with angular momentum increases involvement of sensorimotor brain systems during students’ subsequent reasoning and whether this involvement aids their understanding. The physical experience, a brief exposure to forces associated with angular momentum, significantly improved quiz scores. Moreover, improved performance was explained by activation of sensorimotor brain regions when students later reasoned about angular momentum.

To address these issues, we monitored the happiness and social interactions of more than 30,000 people for a month. We found that patterns of social interaction followed the hedonic-flexibility principle, whereby people tend to engage in happiness-enhancing social relationships when they feel bad and sustain happiness-decreasing periods of solitude and less pleasant types of social relationships that might promise long-term payoff when they feel good.

Difference-in-differences analyses find no evidence that introducing collective bargaining rights led to average increases in the level of resources devoted to education.

To test the relevance of personality for core aspects of sleep, we examined if personality traits across the five broad personality domains predicted behaviourally recorded, week-long sleep characteristics up to five years later (alongside subjective sleep quality). Data from 382 participants (63% female, aged 34–82 years) were drawn from the longitudinal study on Midlife in the United States Study—Biomarker project. In terms of mean tendencies, both neuroticism and conscientiousness signalled more sleep continuity (fewer interruptions) alongside better subjective quality. In terms of intra-individual sleep variability, neuroticism predicted more variability in sleep duration, continuity, and subjective sleep quality, while conscientiousness predicted less variability in sleep duration and sleep continuity. Extraversion, agreeableness, and openness traits did not generally foreshadow behaviourally recoded sleep, only higher ratings of subjective quality. These links were robust to the impact of demographic factors and were not moderated by the duration of time between personality and sleep assessments. The findings distinguish which personality traits foreshadow core aspects of sleep and also implicate multiple traits as predictors of variability, not just mean tendencies, in behaviourally recorded sleep. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:32:45Z,2020-01-30T12:34:59Z,2020-01-30T12:32:45Z,133-153,NA,2,33,NA,NA,Personality and Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2KHIE5VG\Križan and Hisler - 2019 - Personality and Sleep Neuroticism and Conscientio.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FSGXP47C\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,neuroticism; conscientiousness; personality traits; sleep; variability,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000574

However, its functional role in OLGs remains unclear. Herein, we present that IL-33 was mainly expressed in the nucleus of CC1+-oligodendrocytes (OLGs) in mouse and rat corpus callosum, as well as NG2+-oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The in vitro study indicated that the amount of IL-33 expressing in OPCs was higher when compared to that detected in OLGs. Results from the experiments using lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery against IL-33 expression (IL33-KD) in OPCs showed that IL33-KD reduced the differentiation of OLGs into mature OLGs along with the down-regulation of OLG differentiation-related genes and mature OLG marker proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP). Alternatively, we observed reduced differentiation of OLGs that were prepared from the brains of IL-33 gene knockout (IL33-KO) mice with anxiolytic-like behavior. Observations were correlated with the results showing lower levels of MBP and PLP in IL33-KO cultures than those detected in the control cultures prepared from wildtype (WT) mice. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that the myelin structures in the corpus callosum of the IL33-KO mice were impaired compared to those observed in the WT mice. Overall, this study provides important evidence that declined expression of IL-33 in OPCs suppresses the maturation of OLGs. Moreover, gene deficiency of IL-33 can disrupt OLG maturation and interfere with myelin compaction.

To formalize this hypothesis, we created an S-1 bifactor model using 276 participants' Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions. The general factor had significant, moderate associations with self-reported and peer-reported altruism, trust, and trustworthiness. Thus, the positive covariation among economic games is not reducible to the games' shared situational features. Two hundred participants returned for a second session. The general factor based on Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions from this session did not significantly predict self-reported and peer-reported cooperation, suggesting that experience with economic games causes them to measure different traits from those that are reflected in self-assessments and peer-assessments of cooperativeness. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2019-03-20T17:56:32Z,2019-03-20T17:58:10Z,2019-03-20T17:56:32Z,89-103,NA,1,33,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JPWAUV7U\McAuliffe e.a. - 2019 - Does Cooperation in the Laboratory Reflect the Ope.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\545J47VP\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,cooperation; Dictator Game; Trust Game; S-1 bifactor model; social heuristics hypothesis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000580

From the perspective of Social Identity Theory, a strong association between a person and the norm referent group is key to the effectiveness of descriptive social norms on behavior. The general aim of the studies presented in this paper was to examine the effects of descriptive social norm based messages on eating intentions and behaviors, and whether social identity moderates these effects. Study 1 and Study 2 examined whether the effect of a descriptive social norm message promoting vegetable intake (or limiting junk food intake) was moderated by the extent to which participants identified with the norm referent group. We found that centrality of social identification with the norm referent group moderated the effect of descriptive social norm messages on intentions to eat vegetables and intentions to limit junk food intake. Study 3 built on those findings by examining whether priming social identity enhanced the effects of a descriptive social norm message on actual food intake in a laboratory setting. We found that intake of fruit and vegetables was enhanced after exposure to a descriptive social norm message (versus a health message) but this effect was only significant for participants whose identification with the norm referent group had been primed. Taken together, these data add to the suggestion that acting in line with group norms is more likely when individuals regard their membership of the group as being important to their identity.",2019-05-01,2020-02-04T03:40:43Z,2020-02-04T03:41:00Z,2020-02-04T03:40:43Z,217-230,NA,NA,82,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VIHW9QD2\Liu et al. - 2019 - The relationship between social identity, descript.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CNSZSNKH\S0022103118304128.html",NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Social identity; Eating behavior; Manipulation; Moderation; Social norm,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000581

The introduction and widespread acceptance of preprint archived reports and open-source software have made state-of-the-art statistical methods readily accessible to researchers. At the same time, researchers are increasingly concerned that their results should be reproducible (i.e., the same analysis should yield the same numeric results at a later time), which is a basic requirement for assessing the results’ replicability (i.e., whether results at a later time support the same conclusions). Although this age of fast-paced methodology greatly facilitates reproducibility and replicability, it also undermines them in ways not often realized by researchers. This article draws researchers’ attention to these threats and proposes guidelines to help minimize their impact. Reproducibility may be influenced by software development and change over time, a problem that is greatly compounded by the rising dependency between software packages. Replicability is affected by rapidly changing standards, researcher degrees of freedom, and possible bugs or errors in code, whether introduced by software developers or empirical researchers implementing an analysis.

Using a novel approach combining fast-scan controlled-adsorption voltammetry (FSCAV) and single-unit electrophysiology, we have investigated the mechanism of somatodendritic release by directly correlating basal (non-stimulated) extracellular DA concentration ([DA]out), with pharmacologically-induced changes of firing of nigral dopaminergic neurons in rat brain slices. FSCAV measurements indicated that basal [DA]out in the SNc was 40.7 ± 2.0 nM (at 34 ± 0.5°C), which was enhanced by amphetamine, cocaine, and L-DOPA, and reduced by VMAT2 inhibitor, Ro4-1284. Complete inhibition of firing by TTX decreased basal [DA]out, but this reduction was smaller than the effect of D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole. Despite similar effects on neuronal firing, the larger decrease in [DA]out evoked by quinpirole was attributed to cell membrane hyperpolarization and greater reduction in cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in). Decreasing extracellular Ca2+ also reduced basal [DA]out, despite increasing firing frequency. Furthermore, inhibiting L-type Ca2+ channels decreased basal [DA]out, although specific Cav1.3 channel inhibition did not affect firing rate. Inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) also decreased [DA]out, demonstrating the importance of intracellular Ca2+ stores for somatodendritic release. Finally, in vivo FSCAV measurements showed that basal [DA]out in the SNc was 79.8 ± 10.9 nM in urethane-anesthetized rats, which was enhanced by amphetamine. Overall, our findings indicate that although tonic somatodendritic DA release is largely independent of action potentials, basal [DA]out is strongly regulated by voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx and release of intracellular Ca2+.

However, there are competing views on whether financial incentives stimulate coproduction. While some argue that financial incentives increase citizens' willingness to coproduce, others suggest that incentives decrease their willingness (i.e., crowding out). To test these competing expectations, the authors designed a set of experiments that offered subjects a financial incentive to assist municipalities in helping refugees integrate. The experiment was first conducted among university students within a laboratory setting. Then, the initial findings were replicated and extended among a general adult sample. Results suggest that small financial rewards have no effect: they neither increase nor decrease people's willingness to coproduce. When the offered amount is increased substantially, willingness to coproduce increases only marginally.

In Study 1, cross-national analyses show that parties behave more programmatically under compulsory voting and that vote buying is less common where voting is mandatory.

Three experiments tested whether impression updating is influenced by morality, sociability, and competence characteristics to the same extent. Participants were asked to revise their impressions of an individual in light of new and inconsistent information pertaining to his morality, sociability or competence. Results showed that morality was perceived as more informative of interpersonal intentions; therefore a greater impression change occurred when moral information (vs. sociability or competence information) was added to what was previously learned about an individual.

Standardized protocols in data collection, analysis, and interpretation are foundations of empiricism and a healthy sign of a discipline’s maturity. I propose that meta-analysis as typically applied in psychology will benefit from complementing aggregation of observed effect sizes with systematic examination of the standardization of the methodology that deterministically produced them.

Supporting this view, recent                     findings demonstrate that sadness exacerbates financial impatience even when the                     sadness is unrelated to the economic decision at hand.

Although chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel are known to cause tonic activation of presynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) to potentiate nociceptive input, the molecular mechanism involved in this effect is unclear. α2δ-1, commonly known as a voltage-activated calcium channel subunit, is a newly discovered NMDAR-interacting protein and plays a critical role in NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity. Here we show that paclitaxel treatment in rats increases the α2δ-1 expression level in the dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord and the mRNA levels of GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B in the spinal cord. Paclitaxel treatment also potentiates the α2δ-1?NMDAR interaction and synaptic trafficking in the spinal cord. Strikingly, inhibiting α2δ-1 trafficking with pregabalin, disrupting the α2δ-1?NMDAR interaction with an α2δ-1 C-terminus?interfering peptide, or α2δ-1 genetic ablation fully reverses paclitaxel treatment-induced presynaptic NMDAR-mediated glutamate release from primary afferent terminals to spinal dorsal horn neurons. In addition, intrathecal injection of pregabalin or α2δ-1 C-terminus?interfering peptide and α2δ-1 knockout in mice markedly attenuate paclitaxel-induced pain hypersensitivity. Our findings indicate that α2δ-1 is required for paclitaxel-induced tonic activation of presynaptic NMDARs at the spinal cord level. Targeting α2δ-1?bound NMDARs, not the physiological α2δ-1?free NMDARs, may be a new strategy for treating chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.

Specifically, we present four studies demonstrating that facial width-to-height ratio, a stable feature of all faces, biases pain judgments. Compared to those with low facial width-to-height ratio, individuals with high facial width-to-height ratio are perceived as experiencing less pain in otherwise identical situations (Studies 1, 2, & 3), and as needing less pain medication to salve their injuries (Study 4). This process was observed for White but not Black targets (Study 2), and manipulations of facial width-to-height ratio affected pain perceptions even when target identity was held constant (Study 4).

In mortality salient (MS) situations, both spirituality and prosocial money attitudes afford symbolic immortality by self-transcendent connections. In four studies, we found that activating death awareness weakened people’s subjective love of money (Study 1) and predicted increased spending willingness on prosocial rather than proself goals (Studies 2, 3, and 4). More importantly, MS effects on money attitudes were smaller when people’s trait spirituality was high (vs. low; Studies 1, 2, 3) and when people were primed to experience spirituality (vs. happiness control condition; Study 4). For low spirituality people, the association between MS and prosocial spending also depended on the capacity of money spending to contribute positively to one’s feelings of self-worth (Study 3).

While many scholars focus on candidates’ racial/ethnic attributes, ethnic group endorsements are understudied. Whether such endorsements induce voters to choose ideologically similar candidates (spatial voting), or choose based on race/ethnicity (racial voting) is unclear. We address this question by examining elections in multiethnic local settings. Using original surveys and exit polls, we create comparable measures of candidate and voter ideology, and examine how race/ethnicity and ideology affect voters’ choices. We also embed experiments that manipulate ethnic group endorsements. We find that ideology influences voters’ choices, but that ethnic group endorsements weaken spatial voting. The latter effect among whites is driven by racial/ethnic stereotypes. These reactions explain why some candidates seek such endorsements and why others might prefer to avoid them.",2019,2019-03-20T11:50:58Z,2019-03-20T11:51:50Z,2019-03-20T11:50:58Z,5-20,NA,1,63,NA,NA,Racial or Spatial Voting?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"©2018, Midwest Political Science Association",NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YZP8BIVB\Boudreau e.a. - 2019 - Racial or Spatial Voting The Effects of Candidate.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4R22BAPD\ajps.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000598

Cannabinoids have been proposed as treatments for ALS because of their anti-excitotoxicity, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Preclinical studies in mice models of ALS have been published using a range of cannabinoid formulations and doses. To date, there has been no rigorous evaluation of these trials to assess a potential cannabinoid treatment effect. This review and meta-analysis was undertaken to provide evidence for or against a treatment effect of cannabinoids in murine ALS models. Evidence of a treatment effect in mice may provide motivation for trials in human ALS. We identified a total of 10 studies; nine studies using cannabinoid treatment in transgenic SOD1-G93A ALS-model mice and one study in TDP-43 transgenic mice. Eight of the nine studies that used SOD1-G93A mice expressed similarly high copy numbers of the transgene while one study used a low-copy number line. Outcomes evaluated were survival time and disease progression. The latter was measured by motor function and bodyweight decline. Meta-analysis of the mean difference in survival time across the seven studies showed an increase in survival of 3.84 days (95% CI: 0.35–7.32 days; p = 0.031) for cannabinoid treated compared to control SOD1-G93A mice. It was not possible to conduct meta-analyses for motor function decline or weight loss. However, eight of nine studies reported significant improvements in measures of motor function decline and one reported non-significant improvements. Weight loss was significantly attenuated in four of five studies reporting this measure while the other study reported a non-significant attenuation. This review provides some evidence for the efficacy of cannabinoids in prolonging survival time in an ALS mouse model. A delay in disease progression is also suggested following cannabinoid treatment though it was not possible to consolidate the results from reviewed studies. However, studies have moderate to high risk of bias and are highly heterogeneous. Although this review provides some evidence to support the conduct of a cannabinoid trial in human ALS, more standardized studies on specific cannabinoids are necessary before supporting therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in treating patients with ALS.

At the same time, unexpected positive outcomes, often called prediction errors, influence mood. However, a linkage between positive prediction errors—the difference between expected and obtained outcomes—and consequent risk taking has yet to be demonstrated. Using a large data set of New York City lottery gambling and a model inspired by computational accounts of reward learning, we found that people gamble more when incidental outcomes in the environment (e.g., local sporting events and sunshine) are better than expected. When local sports teams performed better than expected, or a sunny day followed a streak of cloudy days, residents gambled more. The observed relationship between prediction errors and gambling was ubiquitous across the city’s socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods and was specific to sports and weather events occurring locally in New York City.

The present research examined age differences in the variance of a range of personality traits, using parent reports of two large samples of children from predominantly the USA and Russia, respectively. Results indicate (i) that individual differences in most traits tend to increase with age from early childhood into early adolescence and then plateau, (ii) that this general pattern of greater personality variance at older childhood age is consistent across the two countries, and (iii) that this pattern is not an artefact of age differences in means or floor/ceiling effects. These findings are consistent with several (noncontradictory) developmental mechanisms, including youths' expanding behavioural capacities and person?environment transactions (corresponsive principle). However, these mechanisms may predominantly characterize periods before adolescence, or they may be offset by countervailing processes, such as socialization pressure towards a mature personality profile, in late adolescence and adulthood. Finally, the findings also suggest that interpreting age trajectories in mean trait scores as pertaining to age differences in a typical person may sometimes be misleading. Investigating variance should become an integral part of studying personality development.

We administered the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) in an SUD-enriched community sample (N = 80). Individuals with more severe SUDs were less likely to use information about expected value when deciding between high-effort, high-reward and low-effort, low-reward options. Furthermore, individuals whose severity of use was primarily related to avoiding aversive affective states and individuals with heightened sensitivity to delay costs during intertemporal decision making were the least sensitive to expected value signals when making decisions to engage in effortful behavior.

Therefore, whether a certain activity is considered multitasking is often a matter of perception. This article demonstrates the malleability of what people perceive as multitasking, showing that the same activity may or may not be construed as multitasking. Importantly, although engaging in multiple tasks may diminish performance, we found that, holding the activity constant, the mere perception of multitasking in fact improves performance. Across 32 studies (30 of which had performance-based incentives) containing a total of 8,242 participants, we found that individuals who perceived an activity as multitasking were more engaged and consequently outperformed those who perceived that same activity as single tasking.",2018-12,2019-04-06T18:38:48Z,2019-04-06T18:38:54Z,2019-04-06T18:38:48Z,1942-1955,NA,12,29,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3QUJGPEK\Srna e.a. - 2018 - The Illusion of Multitasking and Its Positive Effe.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000608

Seventy adults with transdiagnostic anxiety were randomized to receive eight sessions of active ABM (n = 49) or sham training (n = 21). Reaction time and eye-tracking data, collected at baseline, posttraining, and 1-month follow-up, dissociated multiple core attentional processes spanning overt and covert processes of engagement and disengagement. Self-reported symptoms were collected out to 1-year follow-up. Covert disengagement bias was specifically reduced by ABM, unlike all other indices.

Yet, the bulk of this research has not considered how racial stereotypes might also depend on other aspects of targets' identities. To address this, researchers have begun to ask intersectional questions about racial stereotypes, such as whether they are applied in similar ways to men and women, or to children and adults. In the present studies, we examine whether men who are described as gay (vs. not) become de-racialized in the minds of perceivers. That is, we test whether gay (vs. non-gay) men are perceived as less stereotypic of their own racial or ethnic groups. Results consistently support the de-racialization hypothesis, regardless of whether targets are Black, White, Asian, or Hispanic. Moreover, when Black and Hispanic men are described as gay (vs. not), they become stereotypically “Whitened” in addition to seeming less stereotypic of their own racial groups. This “Whitening” effect is explained by Black and Hispanic men's seeming more affluent when described as gay (vs. when not), an effect that holds even when controlling for changes in these men's stereotypic femininity. Collectively, these findings underscore the point that race and sexual orientation are not orthogonal in the minds of perceivers. A minority sexual orientation can alter the racial characteristics ascribed to men, reducing the perceived presence of race-typical traits and, for low-SES men, increasing their perceived “Whiteness.”",2019-07-01,2020-02-06T01:35:37Z,2020-02-10T11:49:50Z,2020-02-06T01:35:37Z,37-54,NA,NA,83,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Racial stereotyping of gay men,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RDLEIJIP\Petsko and Bodenhausen - 2019 - Racial stereotyping of gay men Can a minority sex.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NC9USBXA\S0022103118304876.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Group prototypes; Intersectional stereotypes; Racial bias; Sexual orientation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000614

The nature and stages at which this crowding occurs are unclear, and whether crowding operates via a common mechanism across visual dimensions is unknown. Using a dual-estimation report (N = 42), we quantitatively assessed the processing of features alone and in conjunction with another feature both within and between dimensions. Under crowding, observers misreported colors and orientations (i.e., reported a flanker value instead of the target’s value) but averaged the target’s and flankers’ spatial frequencies (SFs). Interestingly, whereas orientation and color errors were independent, orientation and SF errors were interdependent. These qualitative differences of errors across dimensions revealed a tight link between crowding and feature binding, which is contingent on the type of feature dimension.

We reasoned that increased depression symptom severity would be associated with a reduced ability to override priming from this disadvantageous context. Consequently, we hypothesized that increased depressive severity would counterintuitively be associated with reduced negativity ratings for retrieved personal memories to positive cues on the NAMT.

Defects in lysosomal enzymes that hydrolyze sphingolipids have been relatively well studied. Gaucher disease is caused by the loss of activity of glucocerebrosidase, leading to accumulation of glucosylceramide. Gaucher disease exhibits a number of subtypes, with types 2 and 3 showing significant neuropathology. Sandhoff disease results from the defective activity of ?-hexosaminidase, leading to accumulation of ganglioside GM2. Niemann-Pick type C disease is primarily caused by the loss of activity of the lysosomal membrane protein, NPC1, leading to storage of cholesterol and sphingosine. All three disorders display significant neuropathology, accompanied by neuroinflammation. It is commonly assumed that neuroinflammation is the result of infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the brain; for instance, cells resembling lipid-engorged macrophages (?Gaucher cells?) have been observed in the brain of Gaucher disease patients. We now review the evidence that inflammatory macrophages are recruited into the brain in these diseases and then go on to provide some experimental data that, at least in the three mouse models tested, monocyte-derived macrophages do not appear to infiltrate the brain. Resident microglia, which are phenotypically distinct from infiltrating macrophages, are the only myeloid population present in significant numbers within the brain parenchyma in these authentic mouse models, even during the late symptomatic stages of disease when there is substantial neuroinflammation.

(PPBS) is a class of meaningless statements designed to appear profound. Profundity ratings for PPBS have been found to be negatively related to analytical thinking and positively related to epistemically suspect beliefs (e.g. belief in the paranormal). Conceptually similar traits within the Openness/Intellect (O/I) domain form a simplex, whereby traits are arranged along a single dimension from intelligence to apophenia (i.e. observing patterns or causal connections were none exist). Across two studies (total N = 297), we attempted to replicate the O/I simplex and determine how it relates to perceiving PPBS as profound. Participants completed questionnaires measuring traits from the O/I simplex and provided profundity ratings for PPBS. Profundity ratings of PPBS tended to correlate negatively with intelligence and positively with apophenia. The association with intelligence generally reflected a greater ability to discriminate the profound from the pseudo-profound, whereas the association with apophenia reflected poorer discrimination in Study 1, with less conclusive results in Study 2. In both studies, the O/I simplex was closely replicated. The results suggest a link between the O/I domain and perceiving PPBS as profound and tentatively support the theory that intelligence may protect against apophenia. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019-01-01,2019-03-20T17:56:12Z,2019-03-20T18:00:05Z,2019-03-20T17:56:12Z,72-88,NA,1,33,NA,European Journal of Personality,Openness/Intellect and Susceptibility to Pseudo-Profound Bullshit,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\43UTB8T4\Bainbridge e.a. - 2019 - OpennessIntellect and Susceptibility to Pseudo-Pr.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NEMF6JWJ\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,OSBadgePreregisteredPlus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,apophenia; Openness/Intellect; pseudo-profound bullshit; simplex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a000620

In other words, efforts to improve the general quality of therapy models do not appear to have translated directly into improved outcomes. We used multilevel meta-analytic data from 502 randomized controlled trials to generate a bivariate copula model predicting effect size as therapy quality approaches infinity. Our results suggest that even with a therapy of perfect quality, achieved effect sizes may be modest. If therapy quality and therapy outcome share a correlation of .20 (a somewhat optimistic assumption given the evidence we review), a therapy of perfect quality would produce an effect size of Hedges’s g = 0.83.

However, work making this comparison has reported no difference between these two types of priming. Importantly, the reported non-differences have been found in the visual domain. Here, we investigate morphological (Morph) versus repetition (Rep) priming in two auditory primed lexical decision experiments. Using the English plural suffix -/z/, we compare Rep priming with Morph priming for both singular and plural target conditions (e.g., frog/frogs → frog, frog/frogs → frogs). Overall, we find robust priming in both Rep and Morph conditions. However, for both singular and plural targets, there is consistent evidence that Rep priming is greater than Morph priming at early lags of 0 and 1 intervening items. This facilitation decreases with an increasing number of intervening items. Comparisons with phonological and semantic controls demonstrate that this pattern cannot be attributed solely to shared form or meaning. We interpret these findings in a decompositional model of morphological processing. The robust facilitation in Morph and Rep conditions is attributed to the activation of a shared stem representation. The convergence of Morph and Rep is attributed to a diminishing episodic trace related to morphological recombination.",2019-07-01,2020-01-30T07:06:31Z,2020-01-30T07:06:46Z,2020-01-30T07:06:31Z,122-142,NA,NA,116,NA,Cortex,Differences between morphological and repetition priming in auditory lexical decision,Structure in words: the present and future of morphological processing in a multidisciplinary perspective,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CQV7YVY5\Wilder et al. - 2019 - Differences between morphological and repetition p.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZKSYJIPR\S0010945218303332.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Decomposition process; Lexical representation; Morphological priming; Recombination process; Repetition priming,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000624

In the spatial condition, tasks were framed as measures of spatial ability on which males have an advantage.

In 2 studies, we investigated 5- to 10year-old children’s (Ntotal = 113) preferences for transgender versus gender-“typical” peers who either shared their gender identity or did not. We also examined whether children categorized transgender peers by their sex or expressed gender, as it might inform their evaluations. Children preferred cisgender peers over transgender peers; however, they also liked peers of their own gender rather than the other gender (e.g., female participants preferred girls over boys), demonstrating that the oft-documented own-gender bias plays an important role even when children are reasoning about transgender peers. Children did not reliably categorize transgender peers by sex or gender; yet those who categorized transgender peers by their sex showed greater dislike of transgender peers.

Recent years, however, have witnessed a surge of interest in an alternative statistical paradigm: Bayesian inference, in which probabilities are attached to parameters and models. We feel it is informative to provide statistical conclusions that go beyond a single number, and—regardless of one’s statistical preference—it can be prudent to report the results from both the classical and the Bayesian paradigms. In order to promote a more inclusive and insightful approach to statistical inference, we show how the Summary Stats module in the open-source software program JASP (https://jasp-stats.org) can provide comprehensive Bayesian reanalyses from just a few commonly reported summary statistics, such as t and N. These Bayesian reanalyses allow researchers—and also editors, reviewers, readers, and reporters—to (a) quantify evidence on a continuous scale using Bayes factors, (b) assess the robustness of that evidence to changes in the prior distribution, and (c) gauge which posterior parameter ranges are more credible than others by examining the posterior distribution of the effect size. The procedure is illustrated using Festinger and Carlsmith’s (1959) seminal study on cognitive dissonance.",2018-09-01,2020-01-14T06:58:58Z,2020-01-14T06:59:10Z,2020-01-14T06:58:58Z,367-374,NA,3,1,NA,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,Bayesian Reanalyses From Summary Statistics,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JKTEPLL9\Ly et al. - 2018 - Bayesian Reanalyses From Summary Statistics A Gui.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,effect size; data visualization; Bayesian inference; open materials; hypothesis testing; Bayes factor; cognitive dissonance; effects; p value,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000632

Turkish conservative and liberal students anticipated interacting with a political outgroup (vs. ingroup) member and the accessibility of outgroup and ingroup stereotypes was measured. Conservatives in both outgroup and ingroup interaction conditions showed higher accessibility for outgroup stereotypes. Liberals, however, showed lower accessibility for both outgroup and ingroup stereotypes in both conditions. Liberals’ suppression of stereotypes about the anticipated partner led to worse self-regulation when the anticipated partner was conservative but better self-regulation when the partner was liberal. Conservatives’ stereotype accessibility did not affect their self-regulation. These findings show that liberals may tend to rely on self-regulatory resources to suppress their stereotypes while anticipating inter-ideological interactions, while conservatives rely on stereotypes to navigate such interactions.",2019-01-02,2020-02-04T06:29:03Z,2020-02-04T06:29:20Z,2020-02-04T06:29:03Z,46-60,NA,1,159,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,NA,PMID: 29505340,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\W9G4QX9E\Okten and Saribay - 2019 - Stereotype activation and self-regulation by conse.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RB7BLE2W\00224545.2018.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,stereotypes; self-regulation; Correction; Intergroup perception; political ideology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000634

I argue that these explanations require a longer time horizon than the empirical evidence permits. Education, for example, typically ends in young adulthood and so cannot logically mediate the effect of income on participation in late adulthood. To resolve this temporal problem, I propose that there are two income-participation gaps: one based on current economic status and another on childhood economic history. I situate this argument in a developmental framework and present evidence for it using six studies. The results, while mixed at times, indicate that there are two gaps, that the size of each gap changes over the life course, and that their joint effect creates a larger income-participation gap than estimated by prior research.",2018,2019-03-20T11:40:00Z,2019-03-20T11:40:14Z,2019-03-20T11:40:00Z,813-829,NA,4,62,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"©2018, Midwest Political Science Association",NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5CLHMB86\Ojeda - 2018 - The Two Income-Participation Gaps.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LSDYYFQR\ajps.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000635

The findings to date have been inconsistent and have not always considered the multidimensional nature of psychopathic traits. Moreover, there has been a tendency to confuse psychopathy with other closely related, clinically significant disorders. The current study represents a meta-analysis conducted to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the association of intelligence with global psychopathy, as well as its factors and facets, and related disorders (i.e. antisocial personality disorder, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder). Our analyses revealed a small, significant, negative relationship between intelligence and total psychopathy (r = −.07, p = .001). Analysis of factors and facets found differential associations, including both significant positive (e.g. interpersonal facet) and negative (e.g. affective facet) associations, further affirming that psychopathy is a multidimensional construct. Additionally, intelligence was negatively associated with antisocial personality disorder (r = −.13, p = .001) and conduct disorder (r = −.13, p = .001) but positively with oppositional defiant disorder (r = .06, p = .001).

The older adults’ decision quality was lower than the younger adults’ in the loss domain, and this age difference was attributable to the older adults’ lower cognitive abilities. In addition, the older adults chose the more risky option more often than the younger adults in the gain and mixed domains; this difference in risk aversion was attributable to less pronounced negative affect among the older adults. Computational modeling with a hierarchical Bayesian implementation of cumulative prospect theory revealed that the older adults had higher response noise and more optimistic decision weights for gains than did the younger adults.

This transitive inference occurred in the absence of explicit awareness of the base pairs. However, participants failed to infer the transitive pair from three base pairs (Experiment 2), showing the limits of the transitive inference (Experiment 3).

However, corrective feedback—especially corrective feedback provided by peer interlocutors—remains understudied in naturalistic settings. The present mixed methods study aimed to identify the target and type of corrective feedback provided by both native-speaker and peer interlocutors during conversation groups while abroad. U.S. study abroad students (N = 19) recorded group conversations with native speakers (N = 10) at the beginning, middle, and end of a 6-week stay in Barcelona, Spain. Results indicate a significant decrease in the provision of corrective feedback by both native speakers and peer learners over the course of the program.

Across seven studies (N = 4027), we demonstrate that this assertion is often wrong. Rather than boosting status, many anger expressions predictably diminish status. We find that the intensity of expressed anger profoundly influences social perceptions and status conferral. Compared to mildly or moderately angry individuals, extremely angry people are perceived to be less competent and warm, and are thus accorded less status. We also contrast expressions of anger with expressions of sadness across different levels of intensity. At low levels of intensity anger expressions boost status conferral compared to sadness expressions and a neutral control condition, but at high levels of intensity anger expressions harm status conferral compared to sadness expressions and a neutral control condition. Taken together, our findings reveal that the relationship between expressed emotion and status is far more nuanced than prior work has assumed, and that the magnitude of an emotion can substantively moderate its effects.",2019-11-01,2020-02-06T02:01:43Z,2020-02-10T03:58:57Z,2020-02-06T02:01:43Z,103876,NA,NA,85,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NEIKUWXT\Gaertig et al. - 2019 - When does anger boost status.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Y93PJX4K\S0022103118307315.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Emotion; Anger; Competence; Interpersonal judgment; Status and social hierarchy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000645

Yet both children and adults successfully learn noun meanings at the intended level of abstraction from similar evidence. Xu and Tenenbaum (2007a) provided an explanation for this apparent puzzle: Learners assume that examples are sampled from the true underlying category (strong sampling), making cases in which there are more observed exemplars more consistent with a subordinate meaning than cases in which there are fewer exemplars (the suspicious-coincidence effect). Authors of more recent work (Spencer, Perone, Smith, & Samuelson, 2011) have questioned the relevance of this finding, however, arguing that the effect occurs only when the examples are presented to the learner simultaneously. Across a series of 12 experiments (N = 600), we systematically manipulated several experimental parameters that varied across previous studies, and we successfully replicated the findings of both sets of authors. Taken together, our data suggest that the suspicious-coincidence effect in fact is robust to presentation timing of examples but is sensitive to another factor that varied in the Spencer et al.

Using both field and laboratory data, we find that grocery spending decreases with religiosity. Specifically, we document that people who live in more religious U.S. counties spend less money on groceries and make fewer unplanned purchases. We also demonstrate this negative relationship by measuring religiosity at the individual level and employing a religious prime. That is, the more religious people are, the less willing they are to follow through on novel purchase opportunities that arise during their grocery shopping trips. This effect is consistent with the account that many religions emphasize the value of being prudent with money.

Two accounts have been proposed to explain this relationship, one of which emphasizes proximally avoiding outgroups, and the other of which emphasizes adherence to traditional norms. According to the former, immigrants are perceived as being more infectious because they carry novel pathogens due to their foreign ecological origins. According to the latter, immigrants' foreign norms are perceived as posing a pathogen threat. This study aimed to disentangle these accounts. Participants (N = 975) were randomly assigned to read a description of an immigrant who had high or low contact with locals and high or low assimilation to local norms. The effect of disgust sensitivity on sentiments toward the immigrant (and immigrants like him) was compared across conditions. Results supported the traditional norms account: disgust sensitivity related to anti-immigrant sentiments when the immigrant was described as not assimilating to local norms, but not when he was described as assimilating. Contrary to the outgroup avoidance account, the relationship between disgust sensitivity and anti-immigrant sentiments did not vary across the high-contact and low-contact conditions. Results suggest that resistance to foreign norms, rather than avoidance of novel pathogens, better explains the relationship between pathogen avoidance and outgroup prejudice.",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:43:44Z,2020-02-10T11:48:06Z,2020-02-06T01:43:44Z,103817,NA,NA,84,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Disgust sensitivity and opposition to immigration,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JSTR8KAH\Karinen et al. - 2019 - Disgust sensitivity and opposition to immigration.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4693FE6N\S0022103118304220.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Outgroup avoidance; The behavioral immune system; Disgust sensitivity; Immigration,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000650

Here, we applied a novel ‘connectopic mapping’ data-analysis approach to the resting-state fMRI data of participants of the Human Connectome Project, and demonstrate that the functional organisation of the hippocampal longitudinal axis is gradual rather than segregated into parcels. In addition, we show that inter-individual variations in this gradual organisation predict variations in recollection memory better than a characterisation based on functional parcellation. These results present an important step forward in understanding the functional organisation of the human hippocampus and have important implications for translating between rodent and human research.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:37:39Z,2020-01-30T07:41:20Z,2020-01-30T07:37:39Z,324-335,NA,NA,119,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6DRQGVZZ\Przeździk et al. - 2019 - The functional organisation of the hippocampus alo.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WSACZXK9\S0010945219301832.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hippocampus; Connectivity gradient; Connectopic mapping; Longitudinal axis; Recollection,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000655

So far, the mechanisms underlying framing effects on patience have been elusive. We investigated the role of imagination in these effects. In a behavioral experiment (Experiment 1), a classic framing manipulation (sequence framing) increased self-reported and independently coded imagination during intertemporal choice. In an investigation of neural responses during decision making (Experiment 2), sequence framing increased the extent to which patience was related to activation in brain regions associated with imagination, relative to activation in regions associated with willpower, and increased functional connectivity of brain regions associated with imagination, but not willpower, relative to regions associated with valuation.

We wanted to learn about the rationales researchers have for not adopting the proposed reforms.

Despite this, its contribution to personality development has received little attention. The present three-wave longitudinal study, spanning the age range 7–13 years (n = 1222), sought to fill this gap by examining the transactional pathways between peer sociometric status (measured by peer nominations) and Five-Factor personality traits (measured by self-ratings and parent and teacher ratings). Sociometric status prospectively predicted the development of extraversion. By contrast, agreeableness and neuroticism prospectively predicted the development of sociometric status. Furthermore, individual-level stability in extraversion was associated with individual-level stability in sociometric status. The results were robust across different sources of personality ratings. We argue that peer sociometric status in the school classroom is the type of environmental effect that has potential to explain personality development. Because of its stability, broadness, and possible impact across a variety of personality processes, sociometric status can both repetitiously and simultaneously influence the network of multiple inter-correlated micro-level personality processes, potentially leading to a new network equilibrium that manifests in changes at the level of the broad personality trait. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:49:22Z,2020-01-30T12:50:27Z,2020-01-30T12:49:21Z,606-626,NA,5,33,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CTPU32KD\Ilmarinen et al. - 2019 - Peer Sociometric Status and Personality Developmen.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AGNL9D3U\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,extraversion; development of personality; parallel continuities; peer environment; sociometric status,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000662

One option is to directly target others' behavior through rules and incentives. Another increasingly popular option, however, is to focus on modifying what others think rather than how they behave, and hoping behaviors will then change as a result. The assumption underlying this latter approach is that targeting thoughts and attitudes might be easier or more effective than targeting behaviors. Drawing from psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966), we investigate whether efforts targeted at controlling what people think, rather than how they behave, will indeed be met with differing levels of psychological reactance. Across four studies, we find that people experience greater psychological reactance towards efforts to control their thoughts compared to efforts to control their behaviors. Specifically, thought control, compared to behavioral control, led people to experience greater anger and negativity, and to report lowered motivation to engage in requested behaviors (Study 1). These effects occurred, at least in part, because people perceived that those who try to control their thoughts are likely to try to control their behaviors too, but not vice versa. As a result, thought control elicited greater reactance than behavioral control because the former was perceived as more restrictive than the latter (Studies 2 & 3). We also address other explanations for why thought control may elicit more reactance than behavioral control (Study 4).",2019-09-01,2020-02-06T01:46:13Z,2020-02-10T11:45:08Z,2020-02-06T01:46:13Z,103825,NA,NA,84,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IGNK2P28\Ma et al. - 2019 - Psychological reactance as a function of thought v.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ILF5U8PQ\S0022103118307121.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Behavioral control; Psychological reactance; Thought control,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000664

On the basis of decades of research, it should be especially effective when people adopt the perspective of individuals who hold alternative views. In the current research, however, we found the opposite: In three preregistered experiments (total N = 2,734), we found that taking the perspective of someone who endorses a counterattitudinal view lowers receptiveness to that view and reduces attitude change following a counterattitudinal-argument-generation task. This ironic effect can be understood through value congruence: Individuals who take the opposition’s perspective generate arguments that are incongruent with their own values, which diminishes receptiveness and attitude change. Thus, trying to “put yourself in their shoes” can ultimately undermine self-persuasion.

However, the mechanisms underlying this astrocytic process extension remain unclear. A limitation of the use of 2D cultured astrocytes for such studies is that they display a flat, epithelioid morphology, with no or very few processes, which is markedly different from the stellate morphology observed in vivo. In this study, we obtained 2D cultured astrocytes with a rich complexity of processes using differentiation of neurospheres in vitro. Using these process-bearing astrocytes, we showed that laminin, an extracellular matrix molecule abundant in perivascular sites, efficiently induced process formation and branching. Specifically, the numbers of the first- and second-order branch processes and the maximal process length of astrocytes were increased when cultured on laminin, compared with when they were cultured on poly-L-ornithine or type IV collagen. Knockdown of dystroglycan or α-syntrophin, constituent proteins of the dystrophin?glycoprotein complex that provides a link between laminin and the cytoskeleton, using small interference RNAs inhibited astrocyte process formation and branching, and down-regulated expression of the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Direct knockdown and a specific inhibitor of AQP4 also inhibited, whereas over-expression of AQP4 enhanced astrocyte process formation and branching. Knockdown of AQP4 decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that is critically implicated in actin remodeling. Collectively, these results indicate that the laminin?dystroglycan?α-syntrophin?AQP4 axis is important for process formation and branching of 2D cultured astrocytes.

Yet it seems irrational because it has real costs but may provide no personal benefits. In a laboratory analogue, the third-party-punishment game, third parties (“punishers”) will often spend real money to anonymously punish bad behavior directed at other people. A common explanation is that third-party punishment exists to maintain a cooperative society. We tested a different explanation: Third-party punishment results from a deterrence psychology for defending personal interests. Because humans evolved in small-scale, face-to-face social worlds, the mind infers that mistreatment of a third party predicts later mistreatment of oneself. We showed that when punishers do not have information about how they personally will be treated, they infer that mistreatment of other people predicts mistreatment of themselves, and these inferences predict punishment. But when information about personal mistreatment is available, it drives punishment. This suggests that humans’ punitive psychology evolved to defend personal interests.",2016-03-01,2018-03-20T01:46:37Z,2018-03-20T01:46:46Z,2018-03-20T01:46:37Z,405-418,NA,3,27,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QJM89YVZ\Krasnow et al. - 2016 - Looking Under the Hood of Third-Party Punishment R.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000667

A combination of Bayes analyses and standard regressions revealed that the age at which the children had the conceptual insight that number words represent specific quantities (cardinal value) was strongly related to their later number-system knowledge and was more consistently related to broader mathematics than to reading achievement, controlling for intelligence, executive function, and parental education levels.

Using highly disaggregated election data and an original survey, we estimate that Russian television substantially increased average electoral support for parties and candidates with a “pro-Russian” agenda in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. Evidence suggests that this effect is attributable to persuasion rather than differential mobilization. The effectiveness of biased media varied in a politically consequential way: Its impact was largest on voters with strong pro-Russian priors but was less effective, and to some degree even counter-effective, in persuading those with strong pro-Western priors.

Behavioral research has shown that children and adults share exquisite sensitivity to a defining feature of a boundary: its vertical extent. Imaging studies have shown that this boundary property is represented in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) among typically developed (TD) adults. Here, we show that sensitivity to the vertical extent of scene boundaries is impaired at both the behavioral and neural level in people with Williams syndrome (WS), a genetic deficit that results in severely impaired spatial functions. Behavioral reorientation was tested in three boundary conditions: a flat Mat, a 5 cm high Curb, and full Walls. Adults with WS could reorient in a rectangular space defined by Wall boundaries, but not Curb or Mat boundaries. In contrast, TD age-matched controls could reorient by all three boundary types and TD 4-year-olds could reorient by either Wall or Curb boundaries. Using fMRI, we find that the WS behavioral deficit is echoed in their neural representation of boundaries. While TD age-matched controls showed distinct neural responses to scenes depicting Mat, Curb, and Wall boundaries in the PPA, people with WS showed only a distinction between the Wall and Mat or Curb, but no distinction between the Mat and Curb. Taken together, these results reveal a close coupling between the representation of boundaries as they are used in behavioral reorientation and neural encoding, suggesting that damage to this key element of spatial representation may have a genetic foundation.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:10:14Z,2020-01-30T12:01:30Z,2020-01-30T08:10:14Z,264-276,NA,NA,121,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TVEBTUYB\Ferrara et al. - 2019 - Impaired behavioral and neural representation of s.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UDX6FVTW\S0010945219303089.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Geometric reorientation; Navigation; Parahippocampal place area; Scene perception; Williams syndrome,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000677

However, the mechanism still needs to be further explained. The aim of this study was to investigate whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) participates in regulating GLT-1 during the acquisition of BIT induced by IPC. Initially, cerebral IPC induced BIT and enhanced PPARγ and GLT-1 expression in the CA1 hippocampus in rats. The ratio of nuclear/cytoplasmic PPARγ was also increased. At the same time, the up-regulation of PPARγ expression in astrocytes in the CA1 hippocampus was revealed by double immunofluorescence for PPARγ and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Then, the mechanism by which PPARγ regulates GLT-1 was studied in rat cortical astrocyte-neuron cocultures. We found that IPC [45 min of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)] protected neuronal survival after lethal OGD (4 h of OGD), which usually leads to neuronal death. The activation of PPARγ occurred earlier than the up-regulation of GLT-1 in astrocytes after IPC, as determined by western blot and immunofluorescence. Moreover, the preadministration of the PPARγ antagonist T0070907 or PPARγ siRNA significantly attenuated GLT-1 up-regulation and the neuroprotective effects induced by IPC in vitro. Finally, the effect of the PPARγ antagonist on GLT-1 expression and BIT was verified in vivo. We observed that the preadministration of T0070907 by intracerebroventricular injection dose-dependently attenuated the up-regulation of GLT-1 and BIT induced by cerebral IPC in rats. In conclusion, PPARγ participates in regulating GLT-1 during the acquisition of BIT induced by IPC. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14532.

Although such attributional inferences are critical for understanding the social world, it is unclear whether they rely on processes distinct from those used to understand the nonsocial world. In the present study, we used functional MRI to identify brain regions associated with making attributions about social and nonsocial situations. Attributions in both domains activated a common set of brain regions, and individual differences in the domain-specific recruitment of one of these regions—the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC)—correlated with attributional accuracy in each domain. Overall, however, the DMPFC showed greater activation for attributions about social than about nonsocial situations, and this selective response to the social domain was greatest in participants who reported the highest levels of social expertise.

Sixty native English-speaking listeners (Montreal residents) rated audio recordings of 40 Quebec French speakers of L2 English for five dimensions of oral performance (accentedness, comprehensibility, segmental accuracy, intonation, flow) using 1,000-point continuous scales. Immediately before rating, 20 listeners heard critical comments about Quebec French speakers’ English language skills, while 20 heard positive comments. Twenty listeners (baseline group) received no manipulation. Compared to baseline listeners, positively oriented listeners (younger and older) rated four of five dimensions more favorably. However, listeners’ behavior diverged under negative bias.

We argue that elite polarization as signaled by radical parties' first entrance into parliament leads to voter divergence. Immediately after the election, legitimization and backlash effects mean that voters on both ideological sides move toward the extremes. In the longer term, this polarization is solidified because of radical parties' parliamentary presence. A panel study of Dutch voters shows that the 2002 parliamentary entrance of a radical-right party indeed led to immediate ideological polarization across the political spectrum. Estimating time-series cross-sectional models on Eurobarometer data from 17 countries (1973–2016) shows an additional long-term impact of radical-right party entry on polarization.

This has been classically interpreted as related to a self-other distinction, with impaired visual representations of other bodies seen in third person perspective (3PP), besides spared own body somatosensory representations in 1PP. However, HwA could be impacted by a deficit in the integration of visual and somatosensory information in space, that are spatially congruent in the case of one's own body, but not for others' body. Here, we test this hypothesis in a rare neurological patient with HwA, H+, as well as in a control patient with a comparable neuropsychological profile, but without HwA, and in age-matched healthy controls, in two experiments. First, we assessed body part recognition in a new task where somatosensory information from the participant's body and visual information from the target body shown in virtual reality was never aligned in space. Results show that, differently from the flawless performance in controls, H+ committed errors for not only the body of others in 3PP, but for all conditions where the information related to the real and the target body was not spatially congruent. Then, we tested whether the integration between these multisensory bodily cues in space, as during visuo-tactile stimulation in the full-body illusion, improves the patient's performance. Data show that after the stimulation prompting visuo-tactile integration, but not in control conditions, the patient's abilities to process body parts improved up to normal level, thus confirming and extending the first findings. Altogether, these results support a new interpretation of HwA as linked to the matching between somatosensory inputs from one's body and visual information from a body seen at a distance, and encourage the application of multisensory stimulation and virtual reality for the treatment of body-related disorders.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:52:45Z,2020-01-30T11:10:25Z,2020-01-30T07:52:45Z,212-222,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,You or me?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TVUL4CFH\Bassolino et al. - 2019 - You or me Disentangling perspectival, perceptual,.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TVPR3H3S\S001094521930228X.html",NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Body recognition; Body-related disorders; Heterotopagnosia; Self-other distinction; Stroke; Virtual reality,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000687

In this research, we investigated the extent to which presenting effectiveness information leads people to choose more effective charities. We found that even when effectiveness information is made easily comparable across options, it has a limited impact on choice. Specifically, people frequently choose less effective charity options when those options represent more subjectively preferred causes.

Building on this work, this study investigated whether depressed-affect symptoms influenced risky decision making under time pressure. The effect of depressed affect on risky choice was assessed in a reward (Experiments 1A and 1B) and loss (Experiment 2) context under low- and high-pressure conditions. Decisions involved learning to choose between a “sure” option and a “risky” option with identical expected values. In Experiment 1A, depressed affect predicted increased risky decision making under time pressure but did not affect decision making under low pressure. Experiment 1B replicated this effect. In contrast, in Experiment 2, depressed affect led to reduced risk taking in low-pressure condition but did not affect decision making under high pressure.

We hypothesize that members of host nations will perceive child refugees as having greater potential for cultural malleability than adults, which, in turn, will positively predict their support for acceptance of refugees into their country. In Study 1, participants reported greater perceived cultural malleability in response to images of child Syrian refugees (compared to those of adults with explicit markers of ethnic/religious identity, or groups of refugees), which positively predicted policy support. This pattern was replicated using American (Study 2a) and German (Study 2b) samples, and even when adult refugees were depicted without explicit markers of identity in the images.

Although participants’ reports of mind wandering are often assumed to largely reflect spontaneous, unintentional thoughts, many researchers’ conceptualizations of mind wandering have left open the possibility that at least some of these reports reflect deliberate, intentional thought. Critically, however, in most investigations on the topic, researchers have not separately assessed each type of mind wandering; instead, they have measured mind wandering as a unitary construct, thereby conflating intentional and unintentional types. We report the first compelling evidence that an experimental manipulation can have qualitatively different effects on intentional and unintentional types of mind wandering.

First, theory-based measurement models do not fit the empirical data in terms of traditional confirmatory factor analysis. Second, measurement invariance across age, which is necessary for a meaningful interpretation of age-associated personality differences, is rarely accomplished. Finally, continuous moderator variables, such as age, are often artificially categorized. This categorization leads to bias when interpreting differences in personality across age. In this tutorial, we introduce methods to remedy these problems. We illustrate how Ant Colony Optimization can be used to sample indicators that meet prespecified demands such as model fit. Further, we use Local Structural Equation Modeling to resample and weight subjects to study differences in the measurement model across age as a continuous moderator variable. We also provide a detailed illustration for both tools with the Neuroticism scale of the openly available International Personality Item Pool – NEO inventory using data from the UK sample (N = 15 827). Combined, both tools can remedy persistent problems in research on personality and its development.

The data rescue protocols here address this gap, covering the information lifecycle from handwritten register pages to transcription-ready content, describing the historical data, the database design for the data rescue, and the development of an application design to transcribe the meteorological information directly from an image file to the database. The preparatory steps necessary to organize, curate, image, and structure the meteorological information, prior to transcribing the historical data, are outlined here in an integrated methodology. The initial organization, the development of an image file nomenclature to link the rescued data to the original source, and the description of a metadata schema to optimize the transcription application are all vital to the process of ensuring traceability and transparency in the data rescue process. Taken together, these steps describe best practices guidelines for similar projects. Although we designed the methodology and application to be used in any data rescue context, our particular concern was to accommodate the needs of citizen scientists. We thus focused on making our application easily maintained, flexible, direct to database, clear, and simple to use.

Before this mapping could be implemented, subjects had to make responses in order to advance through screens during a preparatory (“next”) phase. Children (4–11 years old) and late adolescents (17–19 years old) responded more slowly during the next phase when the next response was incompatible with the instructed stimulus-response mapping.

We raise questions about this approach by demonstrating that head movements can dramatically shift the appearance of the face to shape social judgments without engaging facial musculature. In five studies (total N = 1,517), we found that when eye gaze was directed forward, tilting one’s head downward (compared with a neutral angle) increased perceptions of dominance, and this effect was due to the illusory appearance of lowered and V-shaped eyebrows caused by a downward head tilt. Tilting one’s head downward therefore functions as an action-unit imposter, creating the artificial appearance of a facial action unit that has a strong effect on social perception. Social judgments about faces are therefore driven not only by facial shape and musculature but also by movements in the face’s physical foundation: the head.",2019-06-01,2020-01-29T05:58:42Z,2020-01-29T05:58:55Z,2020-01-29T05:58:41Z,893-906,NA,6,30,NA,Psychol Sci,A Facial-Action Imposter,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MXMMC6BG\Witkower and Tracy - 2019 - A Facial-Action Imposter How Head Tilt Influences.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dominance; open data; preregistered; social perception; face perception; head tilt; nonverbal behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000706

The reasons for this are many, perhaps the most influential is the presentation of material from Azerbaijan being confused with southern Azerbaijan in Iran in the wider academic audience and the use of the Cyrillic alphabet for reports written in the Azeri language over the past century. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) and South Caucasus Pipelines (SCP) were constructed through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey during the period 2003-5. BTC was built first from the Caspian Coast to the Georgian border during 2003 and 2004, while the SCP pipeline was built from the Georgian border towards the Caspian and parallel to the BTC in 2005.  To investigate and mitigate the effects of this construction, a four year archaeological fieldwork programme (2001-2005) was carried out, followed by a further six-year post-excavation programme that ended in early 2011.

This so-called vigilance decrement has been attributed to depletion of attentional resources, though other factors such as reductions in motivation likely also play a role. In this study, we examined three electroencephalography (EEG) markers of attentional control, to elucidate which stage of attentional processing is most affected by time-on-task and motivation. To elicit the vigilance decrement, participants performed a sustained attention task for 80 min without breaks. After 60 min, participants were motivated by an unexpected monetary incentive to increase performance in the final 20 min. We found that task performance and self-reported motivation declined rapidly, reaching stable levels well before the motivation manipulation was introduced. Thereafter, motivation increased back up to the initial level, and remained there for the final 20 min. While task performance also increased, it did not return to the initial level, and fell to the lowest level overall during the final 10 min. This pattern of performance changes was mirrored by the trial-to-trial consistency of the phase of theta (3–7 Hz) oscillations, an index of the variability in timing of the neural response to the stimulus. As task performance decreased, temporal variability increased, suggesting that attentional stability is crucial for sustained attention performance. The effects of attention on our two other EEG measures—early P1/N1 event-related potentials (ERPs) and pre-stimulus alpha (9–14 Hz) power—did not change with time-on-task or motivation. In sum, these findings show that the vigilance decrement is accompanied by a decline in only some facets of attentional control, which cannot be fully brought back online by increases in motivation. The vigilance decrement might thus not occur due to a single cause, but is likely multifactorial in origin.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:13:40Z,2020-01-30T07:14:12Z,2020-01-30T07:13:39Z,16-32,NA,NA,117,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HUWEJVHX\Reteig et al. - 2019 - Sustaining attention for a prolonged period of tim.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C4TH8RSW\S0010945219300681.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Motivation; Vigilance; EEG; Sustained attention; Time-on-task,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000713

Our initial hypothesis was that participants might not read attentively, due to perceiving the information to be mundane. Depending on condition, the code word was placed in an early, middle, or late section of the consent form. This experiment allowed us to analyze whether participants read through the consent form, and if they paid more attention to a specific part of the form than others. We asked participants to read through the consent form and sign at the bottom when they were finished. Following their signed consent, we orally gave instructions on how to complete the filler task. At the conclusion of the study, participants were given a prompt to recall the code word.

In this study, we investigate the statistical learning of adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies under low intervening variability using a modified serial reaction time (SRT) task. Young adults were trained on mixed sets of materials comprising equally probable adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies. Offline tests administered after training showed better performance for adjacent than nonadjacent dependencies.

Increasingly, there has been a focus on the specific situations in which particular personality traits predict prosocial behaviour. HEXACO Honesty-Humility—the basic trait most consistently linked to prosocial behaviour in prior studies—has been found to predict prosociality most strongly in situations that afford the exploitation of others. Importantly, though, it may be the subjectively perceived situation that affords the behavioural expression of a trait. Following this reasoning, we tested the proposition that Honesty-Humility would predict prosocial behaviour more strongly in situations characterised by, and perceived to contain, two dimensions of interdependence that can afford exploitation: high conflict and high power. However, across a series of incentivised economic games and two large experience sampling studies, we only found inconsistent evidence for the association between Honesty-Humility and prosocial behaviour. Furthermore, the link between Honesty-Humility and prosociality was neither conditional on objective interdependence nor on subjective perceptions of interdependence. Nonetheless, perceptions of conflict and power tracked objective properties of economic games and were related to prosocial behaviour in the lab and field. Future research should take individuals' subjective understanding of situations into account, which may also help understand the (generalisability of the) effect of Honesty-Humility on prosocial behaviour. © 2019 The Authors.

For example, participants’ envy in February rose as Valentine’s Day approached (as a peer’s enviable date loomed in the future) but abruptly plateaued come February 15 onward (after the date occurred).

By comparison, in the study reported here, we employed frequent hormone sampling to more accurately assess ovulatory timing and used a within-subjects design.

In order to shed light on this matter, we conducted three high-powered experiments using prime images of highly relevant in-group and out-group members expressing happiness and fear. We furthermore varied the social context of the priming task in order to give the “interaction hypothesis” a chance. However, we found no evidence for the interaction reported by Weisbuch and Ambady.

However, even in paradigms with zero risk of sanctions, individuals do not consistently cheat. Still more strikingly, most of the few findings available from studies implementing a sanctioning system run contrary to what would be expected based on utility-based accounts of dishonesty, showing increased cheating when there is a small risk of sanctions as compared to when the risk is zero. Given the striking nature of these findings and the general scarcity of corresponding evidence, we devised a targeted empirical test of the role of sanctions for dishonest behavior. Specifically, in two experiments, we manipulated the probability (i.e., 16.7% vs. 50%) that the factual truth of one's response in a cheating paradigm is checked. In Experiment 2, we further varied the severity of sanctions for being caught cheating. Results showed that the willingness to lie strongly decreased with increasing probability of being caught as well as with increasing severity of sanctions. As such, the results clearly support the theoretical notion that external costs influence unethical behavior, in the direction implied by utility-based models.",2018-11-01,2019-03-30T16:53:32Z,2019-03-30T16:53:44Z,2019-03-30T16:53:32Z,71-77,NA,NA,79,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Daring dishonesty,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I8KSVYMD\Thielmann en Hilbig - 2018 - Daring dishonesty On the role of sanctions for (u.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\G4D582QD\S0022103118301756.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Punishment; Cheating; Costs; Dishonesty; Sanctions; Utility,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000726

We meta-analyzed three categories of quasiexperimental studies of educational effects on intelligence: those estimating education-intelligence associations after controlling for earlier intelligence, those using compulsory schooling policy changes as instrumental variables, and those using regression-discontinuity designs on school-entry age cutoffs. Across 142 effect sizes from 42 data sets involving over 600,000 participants, we found consistent evidence for beneficial effects of education on cognitive abilities of approximately 1 to 5 IQ points for an additional year of education.

As described and instructed, this strategy apparently relies on a spatial/navigational metaphor. The user imagines moving through an environment, placing (study) and reporting (recall) list items along the way. However, whether the method relies critically on this spatial/navigation metaphor is unknown. An alternative hypothesis is that the navigation component is superfluous to memory success, and the method of loci is better viewed as a special case of a larger class of imagery-based peg strategies. Training participants on three virtual environments varying in their characteristics (an apartment, an open field, and a radial-arm maze), we asked participants to use each trained environment as the basis of the method of loci to learn five 11-word lists. Performance varied significantly across environment. However, the effects were small in magnitude. Further tests suggested that navigation-relevant knowledge and ability were not major determinants of success in verbal memory, even for participants who were confirmed to have been compliant with the strategy. These findings echo neuroimaging findings that navigation-based cognition does occur during application of the method of loci, but imagined navigation is unlikely to be directly responsible for its effectiveness.

Study 1 demonstrated that when entity theorists received help from an anthropomorphized (vs. a nonanthropomorphized) helper, they were more concerned about negative judgments from other people, whereas incremental theorists were not affected by anthropomorphic features.

However, it remains unclear whether the cerebral processes supporting these two distinct responses are differentially modulated by reward. In a sample of 35 healthy human adults, we examined brain activations to action and inhibition of action in a reward go/no-go task, with approximately ⅔ go and ⅓ no-go trials. Correct go and no-go trials were rewarded with $1 or ¢5 in reward sessions. Behaviorally, reward facilitated go and impeded no-go. A conjunction analysis showed shared activation to rewarded go and no-go responses in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and inferior parietal cortex. A whole-brain two-way ANOVA of response (go vs no-go) and reward (dollar vs nickel) revealed a significant main effect of response, with greater activity for no-go vs go success in the middle frontal cortex and the reversed pattern in the dorsal ACC, insula, thalamus, and caudate. The thalamus and caudate also responded preferentially to dollar relative to nickel reward during go trials. The main effect of reward (dollar > nickel) involved not only regions associated with reward valuation (e.g., medial orbitofrontal cortex – mOFC) but also those implicated in motor control, saliency, and visual attention including the rACC, ventral striatum, insula, and occipital cortex. Finally, the mOFC distinguished go and no-go responses in the dollar but not nickel trials, suggesting a functional bias toward response execution that leads to larger rewards. Together, these findings identified both shared and non-overlapping neural processes underlying goal-directed action and inhibition of action as well as delineated the effects of reward magnitude on such processes.",2020-02-01,2020-02-06T01:20:08Z,2020-02-06T01:20:29Z,2020-02-06T01:20:08Z,42-56,NA,NA,123,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IK6CNSNY\Le et al. - 2020 - Neural correlates of reward-directed action and in.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7M6Y8WW3\S0010945219303582.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Reward; Behavioral activation; Go/no-go; Response inhibition; Reward valuation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000733

However, results from elections that took place in Europe during the Great Recession and scholarly research on economic voting in these elections cast serious doubts on the causal mechanism. This article directly tests this mechanism with a survey experiment using data from Greece (the country most affected by the debt crisis).

In this article, we show that when scarcity does influence cognition, it renders people less susceptible to classic context effects.

Meth alters neuron and astrocyte activity; yet the underlying mechanism(s) is not fully understood. Here we assessed the impact of acute Meth on human fetal astrocytes (HFAs) using whole-cell patch-clamping. We found that HFAs displayed a large voltage-gated K+ efflux (IKv) through Kv/Kv-like channels during membrane depolarization, and a smaller K+ influx (Ikir) via inward-rectifying Kir/Kir-like channels during membrane hyperpolarization. Meth at a ?recreational? (20 ?M) or toxic/fatal (100 ?M) concentration depolarized resting membrane potential (RMP) and suppressed IKv/Kv-like. These changes were associated with a decreased time constant (?), and mimicked by blocking the two-pore domain K+ (K2P)/K2P-like and Kv/Kv-like channels, respectively. Meth also diminished IKir/Kir-like, but only at toxic/fatal levels. Given that Meth is a potent agonist for the trace amine-associated receptor type-1 (TAAR1), and TAAR1-coupled cAMP/cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA) cascade, we further evaluated whether the Meth impact on K+ efflux was mediated by this pathway. We found that antagonizing TAAR1 with N-(3-Ethoxyphenyl)-4-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide (EPPTB) reversed Meth-induced suppression of IKv/Kv-like; and inhibiting PKA activity by H89 abolished Meth effects on suppressing IKv/Kv-like. Antagonizing TAAR1 might also attenuate Meth-induced RMP depolarization. Voltage-gated Ca2+ currents were not detected in HFAs. These novel findings demonstrate that Meth suppresses IKv/Kv-like by facilitating the TAAR1/Gs/cAMP/PKA cascade and altering the kinetics of Kv/Kv-like channel gating, but reduces K2P/K2P-like channel activity through other pathway(s), in HFAs. Given that Meth-induced decrease in astrocytic K+ efflux through K2P/K2P-like and Kv/Kv-like channels reduces extracellular K+ levels, such reduction could consequently contribute to a decreased excitability of surrounding neurons.

In two studies, female participants engaged in imagined or actual initial interactions with either a straight man or a gay man. After the man’s sexual orientation was revealed, women (particularly attractive ones) who were paired with a gay man reported greater anticipated comfort, which was mediated by their reduced worry about his sexual intentions (Study 1).

We report four studies in which participants (total N = 803) watched videos of targets sharing genuine negative emotional experiences. Participants' multi-scalar ratings of the targets' emotions were compared with the targets' own emotion ratings. In Study 1 we found that having had a similar experience to what the target was sharing was associated with lower recognition of the target's emotions. Study 2 replicated the same pattern and in addition showed that making participants' own imagined reaction to the described event salient resulted in further reduced accuracy. Studies 3 and 4 were preregistered replications and extensions of Studies 1 and 2, in which we observed the same outcome using a different stimulus set, indicating the robustness of the finding. Moreover, Study 4 directly investigated the underlying mechanism of the observed effect. Findings showed that perceivers who have had a negative life experience similar to the emotional event described in the video felt greater personal distress after watching the video, which in part explained their reduced accuracy.

First, fMRI was used to identify the functional brain network involved in a non-clinical cohort. Results indicated that, relative to a control task, the RMET increased activity in a widespread functional bilateral network comprising frontal and temporo-parietal areas. To investigate how damage to grey and white matter components of this network can lead to ToM impairment, parcel-based lesion-symptom mapping (PLSM), white-matter tract-wise statistical analysis (TSA) and disconnectome symptom mapping (DSM) were performed using structural images from 64 stroke patients. PLSM results revealed that low scores on the RMET were associated with damage centered around the right posterior frontal gyrus and insula. TSA and DSM results further revealed that low RMET scores were associated with damage to white-matter tracts connecting frontal and temporo-parietal components of the RMET functional network.

Stereotype confirmation suggests that observers use stereotypes as hypotheses and interpret relevant evidence in a biased way that confirms their stereotypes. Shifting standards suggest that the evaluative standard to which we hold a target changes as a function of their group membership. We examined whether stereotype confirmation and shifting standards effects would be seen in college football coaches during recruiting. College football coaches evaluated a Black or White player on several attributes and made both zero- and non-zero-sum allocations. Results suggested that coaches used the evidence presented to develop biased subjective evaluations of the players based on race while still maintaining equivalent objective evaluations.

We addressed this question by attempting to teach infants words for behaviorally defined action roles. In a series of experiments, we found that 14-month-olds could rapidly learn a label for the role played by the chaser in a chasing scenario, even when the different instances of chasers did not share perceptual features. Furthermore, when infants could choose, they preferred to interpret a novel label as expressing the agent’s role within the observed interaction rather than as being associated with the agent’s appearance. These results demonstrate that infants can learn labels as easily (or even more easily) for concepts identified by abstract behavioral characteristics as for objects identified by perceptual features.

Can third party intervention redirect competitive interactions toward collectively beneficial cooperation? Does mutual cooperation persist when the third party can no longer intervene in the conflict? To address these theoretically and practically important questions, we introduce the Repeated Peacemaker Game. Adversaries and third parties interacted for 60 game rounds in our incentivized experiment, producing a rich dataset of 7200 decisions. Participants made decisions under one of two conditions: In the Early Intervention condition, third party intervention was initially possible and then became impossible. In the Late Intervention condition, third party intervention was initially impossible and then became possible. Third parties in the Early Intervention condition intervened at high rates and established cooperative norms that outlasted the intervention period, resulting in sustainable cooperation even after intervention was no longer possible. By comparison, third parties in the Late Intervention condition intervened at relatively lower rates, but still effectively promoted cooperation, despite the initial history of competition between adversaries. We find strong evidence for ‘conditional cooperation’, whereby adversaries and third parties reciprocate each other's choices in preceding rounds: Adversaries were more likely to cooperate when third parties intervened in the preceding round; third parties, in turn, were more likely to intervene when one or both adversaries cooperated in the preceding round than if both adversaries competed in the preceding round.

Building on these results, Study 2 (N = 299) proposed that the observed vs. anonymous nature of prosocial behavior could account for these differences. Unexpectedly, symbolization predicted both public and private behaviors, whereas internalization generally did not.

Activation in modality-specific regions of cortex is associated with the comprehension of literal language that describes the analogous modalities, but studies addressing the grounding of non-literal or figurative language, such as metaphors, have yielded mixed results. Differences in the psycholinguistic characteristics of sentence stimuli across studies have likely contributed to this lack of consensus. Furthermore, previous studies have been largely correlational, whilst patient studies are a critical way of determining if intact sensorimotor function is necessary to understand language drawing on sensorimotor information. We designed a battery of metaphorical and literal sentence stimuli using action and sound words, with an unprecedented level of control over critical psycholinguistic variables, to test hypotheses about the grounding of metaphorical language. In this Registered Report, we assessed the comprehension of these sentences in 41 patients with Parkinson's disease, who were predicted to be disproportionately affected by the action sentences relative to the sound sentences, and compared their performance to that of 39 healthy age-matched controls who were predicted to show no difference in performance due to sensory modality. Using preregistered Bayesian model comparison methods, we found that PD patients' comprehension of literal action sentences was not impaired, while there was some evidence for a slowing of responses to action metaphors. Follow up exploratory analyses suggest that this response time modality effect was driven by one type of metaphor (predicate) and was absent in another (nominal), despite the fact that the action semantics were similar in both syntactic forms. These results suggest that the conditions under which PD patients demonstrate hypothesized embodiment effects are limited. We offer a critical assessment of the PD action language literature and discuss implications for the embodiment debate. In addition, we suggest how future studies could leverage Bayesian statistical methods to provide more convincing evidence for or against embodied cognition effects.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:08:27Z,2020-01-30T11:59:39Z,2020-01-30T08:08:26Z,362-384,NA,NA,121,NA,Cortex,From action to abstraction,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CWIJG4NG\Humphries et al. - 2019 - From action to abstraction The sensorimotor groun.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KPYECTGJ\S0010945219303235.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Parkinson's disease; Abstraction; Embodied cognition; Metaphor; Simulation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000753

Results showed that degrading either collective ties (i.e., sentiments toward the group as a whole) or relational ties (i.e., sentiments toward individual group members) lowered identity fusion with the group (Studies 1–3 & 6). Lowered fusion, in turn, explained the tendency for weakened collective and relational ties to reduce endorsement of pro-group action, and this effect replicated cross-sectionally and longitudinally (Studies 2, 4 & 6). Additional evidence revealed that attenuated group-related agency seemed to mediate the relationship between weakened identity fusion and diminished commitment to help the group (Studies 3, 4 & 6). Although degrading collective ties reduced overall group identification (Studies 1–3 & 6), degrading relational ties did not reliably do so (Studies 1–6). Instead, degrading relational ties only reduced scores on a single component (ingroup solidarity) of a multidimensional measure of group identification (Studies 5 & 6). Hence, measures of identity fusion are equally sensitive to relational and collective ties while measures of identification emphasize collective ties. The results replicated whether we considered country (Studies 1–5) or gender (i.e. females, Study 6) as the focal social group.

Based on findings suggesting that uncertainty and cognitive dissonance share many underlying features, we investigated whether thinking about religion, either situationally or chronically, buffers against cognitive dissonance. In four methodically diverse studies, we found converging support for this hypothesis. Semantically or symbolically activating Christian religious concepts, as well as being a self-reported believer, attenuated participants’ need to reduce post-decisional dissonance via a spreading of alternatives in a free-choice paradigm (Studies 1, 2, & 4) as well as after counterattitudinal advocacy in an induced compliance paradigm (Study 3). The attenuation of post-decisional dissonance was found for a US American online sample (Studies 1 & 4) and for German university students in a laboratory setting, where the dissonance-inducing decision had factual consequences (Study 2).",2020-01-02,2020-02-04T06:51:23Z,2020-02-04T06:51:45Z,2020-02-04T06:51:23Z,75-91,NA,1,160,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,NA,PMID: 31056019,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2UQWD5EJ\Forstmann and Sagioglou - 2020 - Religious concept activation attenuates cognitive .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\REXY4XPK\00224545.2019.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Religion; cognitive dissonance; free choice paradigm; induced compliance paradigm,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000758

While there is some evidence for this phenomenon in the visual and, to a lesser extent, the auditory modality, little is known about whether it operates in the complex auditory contexts of daily life. Here, we examined how prediction error responses behave in a more complex and ecologically valid auditory context than those typically studied. We created musical tone sequences with different degrees of pitch uncertainty to manipulate the precision of participants' auditory expectations. Magnetoencephalography was used to measure the magnetic counterpart of the mismatch negativity (MMNm) as a neural marker of prediction error in a multi-feature paradigm. Pitch, slide, intensity and timbre deviants were included. We compared high-entropy stimuli, consisting of a set of non-repetitive melodies, with low-entropy stimuli consisting of a simple, repetitive pitch pattern. Pitch entropy was quantitatively assessed with an information-theoretic model of auditory expectation. We found a reduction in pitch and slide MMNm amplitudes in the high-entropy as compared to the low-entropy context. No significant differences were found for intensity and timbre MMNm amplitudes. Furthermore, in a separate behavioral experiment investigating the detection of pitch deviants, similar decreases were found for accuracy measures in response to more fine-grained increases in pitch entropy. Our results are consistent with a precision modulation of auditory prediction error in a musical context, and suggest that this effect is specific to features that depend on the manipulated dimension—pitch information, in this case.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:55:46Z,2020-01-30T11:13:46Z,2020-01-30T07:55:46Z,181-200,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I9Z5H5PH\Quiroga-Martinez et al. - 2019 - Reduced prediction error responses in high-as comp.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TC4IJGN9\S0010945219302412.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,IDyOM; Mismatch negativity; Multi-feature; Music; Precision; Prediction error,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000759

This empirical regularity, known as “post error slowing” (PES), has been traditionally interpreted as the result of a conservative response criterion adopted to avoid future errors and it is supposed to be driven by changes in the excitability of the motor system. However, the consequences of errors have been almost exclusively investigated by means of button-press tasks, which have been criticized because of their limited ecological validity and it is still unclear to what extent errors bias the motor system activity during the planning and the on-line control of complex and realistic goal-directed actions. To overcome these potential limitations, in the present study, we investigated the effect of errors on the preparation and execution of the reach-to-grasp movement, one of the most significant daily life actions. In addition to reaction times (RTs), we measured motor-evoked potential (MEP) to explore the influence of errors on corticospinal (CS) excitability, and we applied kinematical analysis to examine the underlying reorganization of the movement following an error. The results of the present study showed that MEPs tend to be reduced after the failure to reach and grasp an object, supporting the traditional interpretation of PES. Furthermore, in addition to RTs, we found that error-reactivity strategically influences the grasping component of the action, whereas the reaching component appears to be impermeable to PES. These findings demonstrate that the error-reactivity is a strong empirical phenomenon, which spreads into the motor system at the level of both movement preparation and execution, even when more realistic and ecologically valid tasks are used.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:56:40Z,2020-01-30T11:28:47Z,2020-01-30T07:56:40Z,92-100,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WCHRMKGN\Ceccarini et al. - 2019 - Changes in corticospinal excitability associated w.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HTYBUQCP\S0010945219302254.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Kinematics; Motor-evoked potentials; Post error slowing; Reach-to-grasp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000761

We resolve this tension by demonstrating divergent consequences of entitativity for prejudiced individuals versus their groups. Mediational and experimental data from six studies (two pre-registered; N = 2455) support two hypotheses: Entitativity increases how responsible the group seems for its member's prejudice, which in turn decreases how unacceptable observers find the member's behavior and how much they condemn her (H1), but which also increases how much they condemn the group (H2).

Yet the effects of the match between the response associated with the cued object’s identity and the response associated with the target (compatibility effects), which are diagnostic of attentional engagement, were observed only with relevant-color onset cues. These findings demonstrate that stimulus- and goal-driven capture have qualitatively different consequences: Before attention is reoriented to the target, it is engaged to the location of the critical distractor following goal-driven capture but not stimulus-driven capture.

This convention ensures that perceptual impairment arising from developmental prosopagnosia can be distinguished from problems arising from a lack of visual experience with particular facial ethnicities – the so-called ‘Other-Ethnicity Effect’. The present study sought to determine whether the perceptual difficulties seen in developmental prosopagnosia – diagnosed using same-ethnicity faces – extend to other-ethnicity faces. First, we sought to determine whether a group of Caucasian developmental prosopagnosics (N = 15) and typical Caucasian controls (N = 30) had similar experience with same- and other-ethnicity faces during development. All participants therefore completed a contact questionnaire that enquired about their experience of Caucasian, Black, and East Asian faces, at different developmental stages. Importantly, the two groups described very similar levels of visual experience with other-ethnicity faces. Second, we administered a sequential matching task to measure participants' ability to discriminate same- (Caucasian) and other-ethnicity (Black, East Asian) faces. Relative to the experience-matched controls, the prosopagnosics were less accurate at discriminating both same- and other-ethnicity faces, and we found no evidence of disproportionate impairment for same-ethnicity faces. Given that the prosopagnosics and controls had similar opportunity to develop visual expertise for other-ethnicity faces, these results indicate that developmental prosopagnosia impairs recognition of both same- and other-ethnicity faces. The fact that developmental prosopagnosia affects the perception of both same- and other-ethnicity faces suggests that different facial ethnicities engage similar visual processing mechanisms. Our findings support the view that susceptibility to developmental prosopagnosia, and a lack of contact with other-ethnicity faces, contribute independently to the poor recognition of other-ethnicity faces.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:35:08Z,2020-01-30T07:39:30Z,2020-01-30T07:35:08Z,12-19,NA,NA,119,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2V4X8AFP\Cenac et al. - 2019 - Does developmental prosopagnosia impair identifica.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RIHL78TU\S0010945219301662.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Face recognition; Developmental prosopagnosia; Other-ethnicity faces; Visual experience,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000765

Across 3 studies (Studies 1, 2a, 2b; N=416), after an induction of either an entity or incremental view of empathy, aggression, or motivation, participants were asked to imagine someone continually failing to show, or showing in abundance, the particular trait, and were then asked how blameworthy/praiseworthy each of these individuals was. Incremental-induced participants blamed a person showing consistently maladaptive levels of the trait more than did entity-induced participants.

By using within-person designs in a laboratory (Study 1; 187 participants) and an ambulatory assessment study (Study 2; 125 participants), we sought to clarify this ambiguity by investigating whether prominent situational variables (such as motivation and affect) or personality traits can help elucidate when ego depletion can be observed and when not. Although only marginal ego-depletion effects were found in both studies, these effects varied considerably between individuals, indicating that some individuals experience self-control decrements after initial self-control exertion and others not. However, neither motivation nor affect nor personality traits such as trait self-control could consistently explain this variability when models were applied that controlled for variance due to targets and the depletion manipulation (Study 1) or days (Study 2) as well as for multiple testing.

Viral infection also results in the secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6. In this work, we tested whether IL-6 regulates the expression of Na+ and Ca2+ channels post-HSV-1 infection in ND7/23 sensory-like neurons. Our results demonstrate that HSV-1 infection causes a significant decrease in the protein expression of the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channel subunit, despite increasing Cav3.2 mRNA synthesis. Neither Cav3.2 mRNA nor total protein content was affected by IL-6 treatment post-HSV-1 infection. In ND7/23 cells, HSV-1 infection caused a significant reduction in the expression of Na+ and T-type Ca2+ channels within 48 h. Exposure of ND7/23 cells to IL-6 for 24 h post-infection reverses the effect of HSV-1, resulting in a significant increase in T-type Ca2+ current density. However, Na+ currents were not restored by 24-h treatment with IL-6 post-HSV-1 infection of ND7/23 cells. The ability of IL-6 to increase the functional expression of T-type Ca2+ channels on the membrane was blocked by the inhibition of protein trafficking with brefeldin-A and ERK1/2 activation. These results indicate that IL-6 release following HSV-1 infection regulates the expression of T-type Ca2+ channels, which may alter the transmission of pain information.",2019,2020-02-06T02:41:22Z,2020-02-06T02:41:39Z,2020-02-06T02:41:22Z,238-254,NA,2,151,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\634DK7NZ\Zhang et al. - 2019 - Regulation of T-type Ca2+ channel expression by in.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UYR39RES\jnc.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,pain; calcium channel; electrical excitability; interleukin-6; sensory neuron,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000774

Namely, insecure parental attachment (i.e., higher attachment-based anxiety and avoidance scores; Fraley, Heffernan, Vicary, & Brumbaugh, 2011b) can compromise emotion regulation and affect. However, although previous attachment research has addressed emotions during daily positive events (Gentzler, Kerns, & Keener, 2010), to our knowledge no studies have evaluated participants’ attachment in relation to their emotions during major positive life events that involve their parents (e.g., a wedding or holiday). Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate this and extend previous research (Gentzler & Kerns, 2006; Gentzler et al., 2010; Sheinbaum et al., 2015). This is important because major positive life events might solidify internal working models of attachment. Additionally, secure attachment and savoring positive emotions correlate with well-being. Participants (N = 310; Mage = 31.26) completed measures of attachment (i.e., attachment-based anxiety and avoidance) and emotions (e.g., joy, stress) in positive life events involving parents. Results of multiple hierarchical regression showed that insecure attachment predicted decreased joy (p < .001) and increased stress (p < .001) for positive events, after controlling for gender and age. Similarly, for imagined future events, insecure attachment predicted less positive emotions (p < .001) and more negative emotions (p < .001). These results imply that parental attachment can negatively impact positive emotions such as joy during positive life events. Implications and applications are discussed.",2018,2019-04-06T17:15:19Z,2019-04-06T17:15:28Z,2019-04-06T17:15:19Z,119-131,NA,2,23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HXMWAP8R\Camden en Hughes - 2018 - Parental Attachment Predicting Emotions and Stress.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000775

In adults, these values predict gendered role preferences. Yet little work has examined the extent to which young boys and girls explicitly endorse communal and agentic values and whether early gender differences in values predict boys’ and girls’ different role expectations. In a sample of 411 children between the ages of 6 and 14 years, we found consistent gender differences in endorsement of communal and agentic values. Across this age range, boys endorsed communal values less and agentic values more than did girls. Moreover, gender differences in values partially accounted for boys’ relatively lower family versus career orientation, predicting their orientation over and above gender identification and parent reports of children’s gender expression.

Participants? responses (N = 704) to two self?reported questionnaires?Strategies for Pronunciation Improvement (SPI) inventory and Learner Attitudes for Pronunciation (LAP) inventory?were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine the direct and indirect relationships among the latent variables. The results showed that perceived practical and linguistic values related to pronunciation learning led students to be concerned about their pronunciation and thus increased their intentional behavior to improve their pronunciation skills.

In this study, we test a double moderation model in which support for the restriction of civil liberties in the face of threat is moderated by both right-wing authoritarianism and political sophistication. In a national representative dataset (N = 12,507), those low on right-wing authoritarianism became more like their high right-wing authoritarian peers in the face of threat. Also, those more sophisticated about political issues were less supportive of restrictions on civil liberties, but only when threat was low. We tested this model on both restrictions for the in-group, in terms of being wiretapped, and for the out-group, in terms of torturing suspected terrorists.

To address this question, we tested the association between personality profile normativeness (similarity between one's personality profile and the average profile—a proxy for the deviancy–adjustment continuum) and creativity across four different samples (total N = 348 768). We used a wide range of creativity measures, including self-reported, informant-reported, behavioural, and occupational creativity, as well as several essential statistical controls (i.e., demographics, socio-economic background, intelligence, and life satisfaction). Furthermore, we employed both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, including samples of college students and representative adult populations. We found that people who had more normative personality profiles were more creative. However, this association only held within modality (i.e. when both personality and creativity were either self-reported or informant-reported). We did not find robust associations between personality profile normativeness and laboratory-based behavioural measures of creativity, occupational creativity, or creative achievements. We discuss alternative explanations for the observed adjustment–creativity link, specifically, implicit theories of creativity and person perception biases (halo effects).

Here, we tracked within-individual variation in 20 mothers' voices during their first pregnancy, as well as up to 5 years before conception and 5 years postpartum. Voice recordings from 20 age-matched nulliparous women were measured as a control. Linear Mixed Models indicated that F0 mean, range and variation changed significantly following pregnancy in mothers, controlling for age at time of recording, whereas we did not observe any F0 changes across corresponding timeframes in our sample of nulliparous controls. Mothers' voices became significantly lower-pitched and more monotonous during the first year postpartum compared to during pregnancy or before. These F0 parameters did not decrease within-individuals over a 5-year period prior to conception above and beyond the effects of ageing. Although voice pitch decreased following pregnancy, mothers' F0 parameters reverted after the first year postpartum, approaching pre-pregnancy levels.

To many, however, years of reliance on this approach has resulted in a crisis of inference across the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., Rouder et al., 2016). As an alternative to the null hypothesis testing approach, many such experts recommend the Bayesian hypothesis testing approach. Adopting an open-science framework, the present study (a) re-evaluates the empirical findings of 418 t-tests from published L2 research using Bayesian hypothesis testing, and (b) compares the Bayesian results with their conventional, null hypothesis testing counterparts as observed in the original reports. The results show that the Bayesian and the null hypothesis testing approaches generally arrive at similar inferential conclusions. However, considerable differences arise in the rejections of the null hypothesis. Notably, in 64.06% of cases when p-values fell between .01 and .05 (i.e., evidence to reject the null), the Bayesian analysis found the evidence in the primary studies to be only at an ‘anecdotal’ level (i.e., insufficient evidence to reject the null).

These neurons are believed to establish new forms of neuronal communication. The atypical VGLUT3 is of particular interest since in the striatum this subtype is found in tonically active cholinergic interneurons (TANs) and in a subset of 5-HT fibers. The striatum plays a major role in psychomotor effects induced by amphetamine. Whether and how VGLUT3-operated glutamate/ACh or glutamate/5HT co-transmissions modulates psychostimulants-induced maladaptive behaviors is still unknown. Here, we investigate the involvement of VGLUT3 and glutamate co-transmission in amphetamine-induced psychomotor effects and stereotypies. Taking advantage of constitutive and cell-type specific VGLUT3-deficient mouse lines, we tackled the hypothesis that VGLUT3 could gate psychomotor effects (locomotor activity and stereotypies) induced by acute or chronic administration of amphetamine. Interestingly, VGLUT3-null mice demonstrated blunted amphetamine-induced stereotypies as well as reduced striatal ?FosB expression. VGLUT3-positive varicosities within the striatum arise in part from 5HT neurons. We tested the involvement of VGLUT3 deletion in serotoninergic neurons in amphetamine-induced stereotypies. Mice lacking VGLUT3 specifically in 5HT fibers showed no alteration to amphetamine sensitivity. In contrast, specific deletion of VGLUT3 in cholinergic neurons partially phenocopied the effects observed in the constitutive knock-out mice. Our results show that constitutive deletion of VGLUT3 modulates acute and chronic locomotor effects induced by amphetamine. They point to the fact that the expression of VGLUT3 in multiple brain areas is pivotal in gating amphetamine-induced psychomotor adaptations.

There are six separate datasets, with each of three combinations of meteorological driving data (two observation-based and one from climate model ensembles) used to produce two types of outputs (daily time-series of natural river flow for 260 sites, and monthly 1 ? 1 km grids of natural flow and soil moisture in the unsaturated zone). The driving data required by G2G are rainfall and potential evaporation (PE). Two of the datasets from observation-based driving data use rainfall from CEH-GEAR (CEH-Gridded Estimates of Areal Rainfall) with PE from MORECS (Met Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System), and cover the period 1960?2015, while the other two use CEH-GEAR rainfall with PE derived from 5 km temperature data using the Oudin method, and cover 1891?2015. The two datasets based on driving data (rainfall and PE) from the climate model ensembles cover three periods: Historical Baseline (1900?2006), Near-Future (2020?2049), and Far-Future (2070?2099). Data for a 30-year Baseline period (1975?2004), against which the Near-Future and Far-Future periods should be compared, are also available directly. There are 100 members in each ensemble, and the future periods use the RCP8.5 emissions scenario. This paper provides details of the G2G model and the different sets of meteorological driving data, as well as the availability and formatting of the output datasets. It also describes some recent and potential applications of the datasets, which have already been used to support historical and future analyses of low flow and drought characteristics across Britain, and provides some guidance on how the climate model-driven datasets should (and should not) be used.

Research suggests that, at peak fertility, women tend to prefer men with characteristics that reflect good genes for short-term sexual relationships. However, existing findings have been criticized for methodological flexibility and failing attempts to replicate core results. In a large (N=157), pre-registered, within-subject study spanning two ovulatory cycles, we investigated cycle shifts in women's mate preferences for masculine bodies. Using a large set of natural stimuli, we found that when fertile, women's ratings of male bodies increased for sexual as well as for long-term attractiveness. Both effects were partially mediated by the estradiol-to-progesterone-ratio. Furthermore, moderation analyses revealed that both shifts were only evident in women in relationships, but not in singles. Contrary to previous findings, male masculine traits did not interact with cycle phase to predict attraction, indicating that women's preferential priorities do not shift. Taken together, our results do not support women's mate preference shifts, as assumed by the good genes ovulatory shift hypothesis, but are consistent with shifting motivational priorities throughout the cycle.

We report results from two TNT experiments terminating in indirect tests—tests that seem not to measure memory. For a subset of the participants in Experiment 1, latencies to rate word valence were delayed by flankers previously learned but not by flankers previously learned and then suppressed on 16 occasions. For a similar subset in Experiment 2, cue meaning denoted by free associations reflected the meaning established during learning, but less so when targets had been suppressed.

Study 1 investigated whether variation in the diagnosticity of individuating information moderated stereotype bias in implicit and explicit person perception. Increases in diagnosticity produced a linear reduction in explicit and implicit stereotype bias; with more diagnostic individuating information, there was less bias. Studies 2 and 3 examined the effects on person perception of racial stereotypes and of diagnostic individuating information that varied in valence. Study 2 found no substantial implicit or explicit anti-Black stereotype bias in the presence of diagnostic individuating information and large individuating information effects on explicit person perception. Study 3 found no explicit anti-Black stereotype bias in the presence of diagnostic individuating information and that individuating information influenced both implicit and explicit person perception. Together, these studies showed that individuating information can reduce or eliminate stereotype bias in implicit and explicit person perception and that its effect depends on the diagnosticity of the information.

The study includes 120 English-speaking learners of Spanish from 5 course levels and 20 native speakers (NSs) of Spanish.

Nevertheless, prior research has been inconclusive in demonstrating such a link, with longitudinal and experimental studies showing no association between sexual frequency and relationship satisfaction. Crucially, though, all prior research has utilized explicit reports of satisfaction, which reflect deliberative processes that may override the more automatic implications of phylogenetically older evolved preferences. Accordingly, capturing the implications of sexual frequency for relationship evaluations may require implicit measurements that bypass deliberative reasoning. Consistent with this idea, one cross-sectional and one 3-year study of newlywed couples revealed a positive association between sexual frequency and automatic partner evaluations but not explicit satisfaction.

Critically, misinformation led to improved recognition of the original event when subjects detected and remembered a change between the original event and the postevent information. Our research agrees with other findings from retroactive-interference paradigms and can be interpreted within the recursive-remindings framework, according to which detecting and remembering change can enhance retention.

Tic frequency can increase when patients pay attention to their tics, if tics are not suppressed. This study investigates how attentions modulates urge intensity, tic frequency and arousal during free ticcing and tic suppression. Tic frequency (video recording), urge intensity (rating scale) and pupil width (pupillometry as a measure of arousal) were assessed in 23 patients with Tourette syndrome (mean age 33.48 ± 12.37; 14 male) during five attention conditions: 1) baseline, 2) watching own tics in a live video-feedback, 3) watching own tics in a previously recorded video, 4) thinking about situations that can trigger tics and 5) thinking about specific, non-tic related stimuli (distraction condition) during: a) free ticcing and b) tic suppression tic states. Urge intensity and tic frequency increased in the free ticcing condition when patients viewed their own tics live and when they thought about tic-triggering situations. In the tic suppression condition, tic frequency increased when patients watched a video of their tics, thought about their tics or were distracted. Pupil width increased significantly during the live feedback and the video condition compared to baseline in both tic states. Paying attention to own tics can be detrimental when tics are not suppressed. In contrast, paying attention to other stimuli appears detrimental when tics are suppressed, as would be the case during most current behavioural therapy techniques. However, results point to high emotional arousal and patients feeling uncomfortable when seeing themselves tic. The results also suggest that urge intensity is modulated by changes in attention in the same manner as tics and may drive change in tic frequency during free ticcing.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:52:34Z,2020-01-30T11:10:06Z,2020-01-30T07:52:34Z,471-482,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,Help or hurt?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YA4FMWE9\Herrmann et al. - 2019 - Help or hurt How attention modulates tics under d.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WLW6ICAE\S0010945219302618.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Attention; Arousal; Tourette syndrome; Urge; Tics,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000805

Three studies provide support for our interpretation of the Napoleon complex. Our pilot study shows that men (but not women) keep more resources for themselves when they feel small. When paired with a taller male opponent (Study 1), shorter men keep more resources to themselves in a game in which they have all the power (dictator game) versus a game in which the opponent also has some power (ultimatum game). Furthermore, shorter men are not more likely to show direct, physical aggression toward a taller opponent (Study 2).

A third group of participants received no appraisal instructions and responded naturally to the demonstrator. During a later test, participants who had enhanced their empathy evinced the strongest vicarious fear learning as measured by skin conductance responses to the conditioned stimulus in the absence of the demonstrator.

From labor-market entry to middle age, individuals with low self-control experienced 1.6 times as many months of unemployment as those with high self-control. Analysis of monthly unemployment data before and during the 1980s recession showed that individuals with low self-control experienced the greatest increases in unemployment during the recession. Our results underscore the critical role of self-control in shaping life-span trajectories of occupational success and in affecting how macroeconomic conditions affect unemployment levels in the population.",2015-06-01,2018-03-20T04:50:45Z,2018-03-20T04:50:54Z,2018-03-20T04:50:45Z,709-723,NA,6,26,NA,Psychol Sci,Childhood Self-Control and Unemployment Throughout the Life Span,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5RYF9V22\Daly et al. - 2015 - Childhood Self-Control and Unemployment Throughout.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000814

We argue that through time and in different periods of occupation - Middle Palaeolithic, Iron Age, Late Medieval, and Modern - the valley's residents have met similar challenges of extreme geography and a harsh environment differently, in particular by interacting in different ways and at different levels of intensity with the outside world.  These shifts caused changes in population, settlement, and socio-political organisation that are reflected strongly in the local landscape and built environment.  Population, settlement, and socio-political organisation did not hold constant, but were influenced by external forces, despite the seeming isolation of the valley and its occupants.

Modern reinforcement-learning theories formalize this distinction as a competition between a computationally cheap but inaccurate model-free system that gives rise to habits and a computationally expensive but accurate model-based system that implements planning. It is unclear, however, how people choose to allocate control between these systems. Here, we propose that arbitration occurs by comparing each system’s task-specific costs and benefits. To investigate this proposal, we conducted two experiments showing that people increase model-based control when it achieves greater accuracy than model-free control, and especially when the rewards of accurate performance are amplified. In contrast, they are insensitive to reward amplification when model-based and model-free control yield equivalent accuracy.

We found that toddlers can use the time and effort associated with goal-directed actions to distinguish agents, and that children prefer agents who incur fewer costs in completing a goal. When two agents refuse to help, children retain a preference for the more competent agent but infer that the less competent agent is nicer.

Many studies have investigated the nomological network of multidimensional perfectionism by relating perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic strivings to the Big Five personality traits. Results from these studies were largely inconsistent. In the present study, we meta-analytically integrated 672 effect sizes from 72 samples (N = 21 573) describing relations between multidimensional perfectionism and the Big Five personality traits. Perfectionistic concerns correlated positively with Neuroticism (r = 0.383) and negatively with Extraversion (r = −0.198), Agreeableness (r = −0.198), Conscientiousness (r = −0.111), and Openness (r = −0.087). Perfectionistic strivings correlated positively with Conscientiousness (r = 0.368), Openness (r = 0.121), Neuroticism (r = 0.090), and Extraversion (r = 0.067) and were unrelated to Agreeableness (r = 0.002). The measures of perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic strivings moderated most of these relations. Meta-analytic structural equation modelling allowed controlling each perfectionism dimension for the respective other. This partialling increased all correlations with the exception of the previously positive correlation between perfectionistic strivings and Neuroticism, which ceased to be significant. The findings support the distinction between perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns and demonstrate how multidimensional perfectionism is situated in the context of broader personality traits. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:33:24Z,2020-01-30T12:35:30Z,2020-01-30T12:33:24Z,176-196,NA,2,33,NA,NA,Multidimensional Perfectionism and the Big Five Personality Traits,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\E4FKAAJX\Stricker et al. - 2019 - Multidimensional Perfectionism and the Big Five Pe.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QR7ADPK4\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,meta-analysis; structural equation modelling; Big Five; perfectionism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000818

N-glycosylation is one of the major post-translational modifications of membrane proteins, but its specific roles in neurons remain largely unknown. AMPA-R subunits are N-glycosylated at their extracellular domains during their biosynthesis in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi system. Six N-glycosylation sites are presumed to exist in the extracellular domain of GluA1, which is a member of the AMPA-R subunits. We observed that the intracellular trafficking and cell surface expression were strongly suppressed in the GluA1 mutants lacking N-glycans at N63/N363 in HEK293T cells. Multimer analysis using Blue Native-PAGE displayed the impaired tetramer formation in the glycosylation mutants (N63S and N363S), indicating that the mis-transport was caused by impaired tetramer formation. N63S and N363S mutants were primarily degraded via the lysosomal pathway. Flag-tagged N363S GluA1, but not N63S GluA1, expressed in primary cortical neuron cultures prepared from GluA1 knockout mice was observed to localize at the cell surface. Co-expression of GluA2 partially rescued tetramer formation and the cell surface expression of N363S GluA1 but not N63S GluA1, in HEK293T cells. Electrophysiological analysis also demonstrated functional heteromers of N363S GluA1 with GluA2. These data suggest that site-specific N-glycans on GluA1 subunit regulates tetramer formation, intracellular trafficking, and cell surface expression of AMPA-R.

Forty-eight Korean learners of L2 English were randomly assigned into a captions group (n = 24) and an enhanced captions group (n = 24). For the enhanced captions group, the components of pronominal anaphoric reference were boldfaced in the treatment task input. Learner attention to anaphora antecedents and personal pronouns was assessed with eye-movement indices, and a written and an oral grammaticality judgment test were used to measure learning gains. Textual enhancement succeeded in directing learner attention to the anaphora antecedents, and led to increased gains in receptive knowledge of pronominal anaphoric reference.

Moreover, we address three major methodological limitations of previous research in this area: a lack of an unconstrained control condition; non-compliance with time manipulations leading to high rates of exclusions and thus a selection bias; and non-comprehension of the structure of the game.

This study uses web-based GIS and database technologies to provide a complete landscape data set and a fully integrated interpretative text carefully grounded in current landscape theory. The material comes from the Troodos Archaeological and Environmental Survey Project, which carried out intensive survey in the northern foothills of the Troodos Mountains in central Cyprus between 2000 and 2004. This survey covered all periods from the Neolithic to the present day, a wide range of topographical and environmental contexts, and a broad spectrum of disciplinary and interdisciplinary expertise. In this study we focus on some core themes, particularly the relationship between farming and mining, the control of production, and the spatial differentiation of human activity across the landscape.

Here, we describe the additive-area heuristic, a means of rapidly estimating visual area that results in substantial distortions of perceived area in many contexts, visible even in simple demonstrations. We show that when we controlled for additive area, observers were unable to discriminate on the basis of true area, per se, and that these results could not be explained by other spatial dimensions.

Here, observers estimated the average emotion of a crowd of dynamic faces. The members of some crowds changed their expressions synchronously, whereas individuals in other crowds acted asynchronously.

Although numerous studies support this theoretical process model, no research to date has ever found that DTA mediates the effect of MS in a single study, using the measurement-of-mediation approach. In this paper, we argue that the lack of evidence for this effect is due to methodological issues associated with the measurement of DTA. Specifically, measuring DTA primes death-thoughts and thereby disrupts the psychological processes that are typically initiated by MS. We provide evidence for this theorizing in three studies. Study 1 shows that merely administering a DTA task (vs. a neutral non-death-related task) increases distal self-esteem enhancement following a delay period (cf., a typical MS effect). Study 2 is a preregistered replication of Study 1, and found parallel effects, but only among participants who did not speed through the study. Study 3 demonstrates that whereas MS increases self-enhancement after a delay when DTA is not measured, administering a DTA task following MS eliminates this effect. Implications for understanding the implicit processes initiated in response to MS are discussed, and methodological recommendations for conducting empirically sound MS studies are suggested.",2018-01-01,2018-04-05T23:55:32Z,2018-04-05T23:56:40Z,2018-04-05T23:55:32Z,257-269,NA,NA,74,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Unintended effects of measuring implicit processes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QP8ESNBL\Hayes and Schimel - 2018 - Unintended effects of measuring implicit processes.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5XIQV9G4\S0022103117303517.html,NA,OSBadgePreregisteredPlus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Death-thought accessibility; Mediation; Mortality salience; Process; Terror management theory,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a000830

We integrated the social-projection and stress-mindset literatures to investigate, for the first time, the effect of holding a stress-is-enhancing, versus a stress-is-debilitating, mindset on social judgments of a target's strain, on the perceiver's consequent perceptions of the target's promotability, and on his or her intention to voluntarily help the target. We argued that perceivers may project their own stress-mindsets onto others, resulting in egocentrically-biased judgments of the latter's strain. We conducted four experimental and correlational studies, among 971 fully-employed Americans and Israelis, using a novel stress-mindset manipulation. We predicted and found evidence that, independent of the effects of mood, individuals holding a stress-is-enhancing versus a stress-is-debilitating mindset were less likely to judge a target experiencing a heavy workload as suffering from burnout, somatic symptoms, or presenteeism (i.e., reduced productivity at work due to health problems). We also revealed two important downstream outcomes: whereas the lower strain judgments associated with a stress-is-enhancing mindset led to a higher estimate of the target's promotability, they also led to a lower likelihood of helping him. Taken together, our findings establish a causal link between stress-mindset and judgments of others' strain, thereby extending the novel notion of stress-mindset beyond intra-personal outcomes to inter-personal effects.

Results showed that there was a medium effect (r = .34) of repetition on incidental vocabulary learning. Subsequent moderator analyses revealed that variability in the size of repetition effects across studies was explained by learner variables (age, vocabulary knowledge), treatment variables (spaced learning, visual support, engagement, range in number of encounters), and methodological differences (nonword use, forewarning of an upcoming comprehension test, vocabulary test format).

In the current study, such measures were used to determine how the two systems interact in a naturalistic second language (L2) acquisition context. One hundred advanced L2 speakers of Japanese living in Japan were assessed using tests of automatized explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge, along with tests of phonological short?term memory and aptitude tests for explicit and implicit learning.

Participants in the phonological specificity training (with phonological manipulation) and the picture selection (without phonological manipulation) experimental conditions had to select the corresponding picture from among competitors after hearing a word. Phonological specificity training resulted in increased learning (measured through word translation) compared to the control condition on the posttest whereas picture selection produced increased learning only for participants with larger initial vocabulary sizes. Both experimental conditions showed increased learning for participants with larger vocabulary sizes on the retention test.

The results suggest that propensity for risk taking tends to decline across the life span in the vast majority of countries.

Across five experiments (N = 800), people endorsed unfamiliar behaviors described with generic-you (e.g., “You share them with your friends”) as more normatively correct than behaviors expressed with ‘I’ (e.g., “I share them with my family”) or third-person singular pronouns (“he” or “she”; e.g., “She shares them with her family”). These effects persisted even when participants were told that their informants were highly knowledgeable about the norms. Together, these findings indicate that generic-you functions as a linguistic nudge that carries persuasive force. Broadly, they add to a growing body of literature on how subtle linguistic shifts can meaningfully influence social cognition.",2019-11-01,2020-02-06T01:59:32Z,2020-02-10T04:04:22Z,2020-02-06T01:59:32Z,103869,NA,NA,85,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,“You” and “I” in a foreign land,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FAJGP9FF\Orvell et al. - 2019 - “You” and “I” in a foreign land The persuasive fo.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GL52DITR\S0022103119301568.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Norms; Generics; Language; Nudges; Persuasion,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000848

Yet current practice is to use statistical tests with an inappropriate null hypothesis of no difference, which can result in equating nonsignificant differences with significant homogeneity. Instead, we argue that researchers should begin with the initial hypothesis that the data are inconsistent with a valid research design, and provide sufficient statistical evidence in favor of a valid design. When tests are correctly specified so that difference is the null and equivalence is the alternative, the problems afflicting traditional tests are alleviated. We argue that equivalence tests are better able to incorporate substantive considerations about what constitutes good balance on covariates and placebo outcomes than traditional tests.

Overall, we found a reliable sensitivity to L2 morphosyntax at advanced proficiencies (d = .20, 95% CIs .15, .25), with some evidence that this was reliably lower than for native speakers (NSs). These patterns were not generally moderated by linguistic feature or sentence region.

However, the molecular mechanism is still elusive. This study focused on the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) delivery of lenti-HSPB8 virus against neurological injury in a rat model of cerebral I/R and explored the underlying mechanism. We found that lentivirus i.c.v injection-induced HSPB8 over-expression strongly alleviated infarct volume, improved neurobehavioral outcomes, and reduced brain edema in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model. Concomitantly, HSPB8 over-expression noticeably prevented blood?brain barrier (BBB) disruption after cerebral I/R injury as indicated by the reduction in Evans blue leakage and IgG detection in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared with the vehicle group. Moreover, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining of tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin showed that HSPB8 over-expression prevented the degradation of these proteins induced by MCAO/R, which indicated the protective effect of HSPB8 on BBB. Western blotting and immunostaining techniques were also utilized to analyze the expression of the markers of autophagy. We found that HSPB8 over-expression promoted autophagic flux, evidenced by increased ratio of LC3 I/II, accumulation of Beclin-1 expression and enhanced p62 degradation. i.c.v injection of 15 ?g autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was applied at the onset of reperfusion. The results showed that 3-MA elicited a significant loss of the protective effect of HSPB8 against MCAO/R-induced neurological defect, Evans blue extravasation, and the loss tight junction proteins, suggesting that the BBB protective role of HSPB8 was, at least in part, mediated through autophagy. Collectively, HSPB8 may represent a potential therapeutic agent for preserving BBB integrity following cerebral I/R injury.

While this process has been well-established for basic (e.g., grasping) and complex (e.g., dancing) actions, it remains unknown if the framework of action simulation is applicable to visual languages such as American Sign Language (ASL). We conducted an EEG experiment with deaf signers and hearing non-signers to compare overall sensorimotor EEG between groups, and to test whether sensorimotor systems are differentially sensitive to signs that are produced with one hand (“1H”) or two hands (“2H”). We predicted greater alpha and beta event-related desynchronization (previously correlated with action simulation) during the perception of 2H ASL signs compared to 1H ASL signs, due to greater demands on sensorimotor processing systems required for producing two-handed actions. We recorded EEG from both groups as they observed videos of ASL signs, half 1H and half 2H. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) in the alpha and beta ranges were computed for the two conditions at central electrode sites overlying the sensorimotor cortex. Sensorimotor EEG responses in both Hearing and Deaf groups were sensitive to the observed gross motor characteristics of the observed signs. We show for the first time that despite hearing non-signers showing overall more sensorimotor cortex involvement during sign observation, mirroring-related processes are in fact involved when deaf signers observe signs.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:36:10Z,2020-01-30T07:40:19Z,2020-01-30T07:36:10Z,457-469,NA,NA,119,NA,Cortex,Sensorimotor system engagement during ASL sign perception,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TP2IA6KY\Kubicek and Quandt - 2019 - Sensorimotor system engagement during ASL sign per.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ABIXWVBR\S0010945219302849.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,EEG; Action simulation; ASL; Sign language,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000854

Across six studies, we showed that these tendencies are robust, large in magnitude, tuned to intentional rather than unintentional noncontribution, and generally consistent across third- and first-party cases. Further, these effects cannot be accounted for by factors that frequently co-occur with free riding, such as nonconforming behaviors or the costs that free riding imposes on the group.

Evidence suggests that oligomeric species of α-synuclein (αSO) are the genuine neurotoxins of PD. Although several studies have supported the direct neurotoxic effects of αSO on neurons, their effects on astrocytes have not been directly addressed. Astrocytes are essential to several steps of synapse formation and function, including secretion of synaptogenic factors, control of synaptic elimination and stabilization, secretion of neural/glial modulators, and modulation of extracellular ions, and neurotransmitter levels in the synaptic cleft. Here, we show that αSO induced the astrocyte reactivity and enhanced the synaptogenic capacity of human and murine astrocytes by increasing the levels of the known synaptogenic molecule transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1). Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of αSO in mice increased the number of astrocytes, the density of excitatory synapses, and the levels of TGF-β1 in the striatum of injected animals. Inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling impaired the effect of the astrocyte-conditioned medium on glutamatergic synapse formation in vitro and on striatal synapse formation in vivo, whereas addition of TGF-β1 protected mesencephalic neurons against synapse loss triggered by αSO. Together, our data suggest that αSO have important effects on astrocytic functions and describe TGF-β1 as a new endogenous astrocyte-derived molecule involved in the increase in striatal glutamatergic synaptic density present in early stages of PD.

The present study addressed the question of whether this efficiency scales up to dyads working together to achieve a shared goal: Do people act efficiently as a group (i.e., coefficiently), or do they minimize their own or their partner’s individual costs even if this increases the overall cost for the group? We devised a novel, touch-screen-based, sequential object-transfer task to measure how people choose between different paths to coordinate with a partner. Across multiple experiments, we found that participants did not simply minimize their own or their partner’s movement costs but made coefficient decisions about paths, which ensured that the aggregate costs of movement for the dyad were minimized.

However, it is unknown whether humans use this causal relation as a constraint in perception and inference with body movements. In the present study, participants rated actions of other individuals as more natural when limb movements (as a cause) occurred before body displacements (as an effect) than when limb movements temporally lagged behind body displacements. This causal expectation for human body movements not only affected perceptual impressions regarding the naturalness of observed actions but also guided the interpretation of motion cues within a more generalized causal context.

Capraro and Rand (Judgment and Decision Making, 13, 99–111, 2018) recently provided experimental evidence that prosociality in anonymous, one-shot interactions (such as Prisoner's Dilemma and Dictator Game experiments) is not driven by outcome-based social preferences – as classically assumed – but by a generalized morality preference for “doing the right thing”. Here we argue that the key experiments reported in Capraro and Rand (2018) comprise prominent methodological confounds and open questions that bear on influential psychological theory. Specifically, their design confounds: (i) preferences for efficiency with self-interest; and (ii) preferences for action with preferences for morality. Furthermore, their design fails to dissociate the preference to do “good” from the preference to avoid doing “bad”. We thus designed and conducted a preregistered, refined and extended test of the morality preference hypothesis (N = 801). Consistent with this hypothesis, our findings indicate that prosociality in the anonymous, one-shot Dictator Game is driven by preferences for doing the morally right thing. Inconsistent with influential psychological theory, however, our results suggest the preference to do “good” was as potent as the preference to avoid doing “bad” in this case.",2018-11-01,2019-03-30T17:05:57Z,2019-03-30T17:06:10Z,2019-03-30T17:05:57Z,64-70,NA,NA,79,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Doing good vs. avoiding bad in prosocial choice,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3PDN5WHN\Tappin en Capraro - 2018 - Doing good vs. avoiding bad in prosocial choice A.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\W3P2A9R5\S0022103118302841.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,OSBadgePreregisteredPlus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a000862

When role demands to maximize candidate fit in hiring selections were strong, preference for job candidates of a given group tended to be lower when there were cues to third-party prejudice against that group (vs. no cues), irrespective of in-group favoritism effects (Studies 1–5) or participant attitudes (Studies 4 and 5). We found supporting evidence for the underlying processes in the context of hiring selections involving fictional groups (Study 1) as well as female job candidates (Studies 2–5). A concern with meeting the demands of the gatekeeper role was at the root of prejudice accommodation: When role-demands to prioritize candidate fit were strong, role-relevant considerations (interpersonal and task-focused) mediated the accommodation effect (Studies 1 and 4). The more gatekeepers in charge of hiring sought to meet role demands by considering the preferences of relevant third parties, the more they accommodated third-party prejudice (Study 2). Moreover, role-based concerns mediated the accommodation of prejudice—but not other potential considerations that were unrelated to role demands (Study 3). Finally, the accommodation effect was eliminated when the role definition did not prioritize candidate fit (Study 4) and when we experimentally reduced the strength of role-related concerns (Study 5).

I support this argument by examining the rise of online female preachers in the Islamist Salafi movement, using interviews, Twitter analysis, and automated text analysis of 21,000 texts by 172 men and 43 women on the Salafi-oriented website saaid.net.

In three longitudinal experiments in food-processing factories, we tested two decoy sanitation options that were worse than the existing sanitizer spray bottle. Results showed that the presence of a decoy, but not an additional copy of the original sanitizer bottle in a different color, drastically increased food workers’ hand sanitizer use from the original sanitizer bottle and, consequently, improved workers’ passing rate in hand sanitation tests from 60% to 70% to above 90% for 20 days.

Although there is some consensus that better behavioral outcomes are achieved when activation is restored to the left hemisphere, the circumstances that dictate how and why regions in both hemispheres respond to naming therapy are still unclear. In this study, an fMRI picture-naming task was used to examine 16 regions of interest in 26 patients with chronic aphasia before and after 12 weeks of semantic naming treatment. Ten control patients who did not receive treatment and 17 healthy controls were also scanned. Naming therapy resulted in a significant increase in cortical activation, an effect that was largely driven by patients who responded most favorably to treatment, as patients who responded less favorably (as well as those who did not receive treatment) had little change in activation over time. Relative to healthy controls, patients had higher pre-treatment activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFG) and lower activation in the bilateral angular gyri; after treatment, they had higher activation in bilateral IFG, as well as in the right middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that the predominant effect of beneficial naming treatment was an upregulation of traditional language areas and their right hemisphere homologues and, in particular, regions associated with phonological and semantic/executive semantic processing, as well as broader domain general functions. Additionally, in some left hemisphere regions, post-treatment changes in activation were greater when there was more damage than when there was less damage, indicating that spared tissue in otherwise highly damaged regions can be modulated by treatment.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:08:14Z,2020-01-30T11:59:24Z,2020-01-30T08:08:14Z,147-168,NA,NA,121,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UJD77HFF\Johnson et al. - 2019 - Treatment-related changes in neural activation var.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TZDAZ28N\S0010945219303053.html,NA,OSBadgePreregistered,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,fMRI; Aphasia; Language rehabilitation; Picture naming; Region of interest (ROI) analysis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000870

Mice were subjected to rotarod tests of motor coordination, and open field and cylinder tests for spontaneous locomotor activity and postural axial support. To measure DA release in dorsal striatum and the shell of Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), we used ex vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in 6- to 24-week-old mice. To determine decline of DA transporter function, we used 18FE-PE2I positron emission tomography. We show here that fast-scan cyclic voltammetry is a sensitive tool to detect evoked DA release dysfunction in MitoPark mice and that electrically evoked DA release is affected earlier in nigrostriatal than mesolimbic DA systems. DA reuptake was also affected more slowly in NAc shell. Positron emission tomography data showed DA uptake to be barely above detection levels in 16- and 20-week-old MitoPark mice. Rotarod performance was not impaired until mice were 16 weeks old, when evoked DA release in striatum had decreased to ≈ 40% of wild-type levels. In contrast, impairment of open field locomotion and rearing began at 10 weeks, in parallel with the initial modest decline of evoked DA release. We conclude that forced behaviors, such as motivation not to fall, can be partially maintained even when DA release is severely compromised, whereas spontaneous behaviors are much more sensitive to impaired DA release, and that presumed secondary non-dopaminergic system alterations do not markedly counteract or aggravate effects of severe impairment of DA release.

Using mixed-effects logistic regressions, we reanalyzed 58 parental reports of native-signing deaf children’s productive acquisition of 332 signs in American Sign Language (ASL; Anderson & Reilly, 2002) and found that iconicity, neighborhood density, and lexical frequency independently facilitated vocabulary acquisition.

One previous study linked mentalizing ability to individual differences in the personality trait Agreeableness. Agreeableness encompasses two major subdimensions: Compassion reflects tendencies toward empathy, prosocial behaviour, and interpersonal concern, whereas Politeness captures tendencies to suppress aggressive and exploitative impulses. We hypothesized that Compassion but not Politeness would be associated with better mentalizing ability. This hypothesis was confirmed in Study 1 (N = 329) using a theory of mind task that required reasoning about the beliefs of fictional characters. Post hoc analyses indicated that the honesty facet of Agreeableness was negatively associated with mentalizing. In Study 2 (N = 217), we examined whether individual differences in mentalizing and related traits were associated with patterns of resting?state functional connectivity in the brain. Performance on the theory of mind task was significantly associated with patterns of connectivity between the dorsal medial and core subsystems of the default network, consistent with evidence implicating these regions in mentalization.

With precise measurements of each chick’s behavior, we were able to perform individual-level analyses and substantially reduce measurement error for the group-level analyses. We found no evidence that newborn chicks encode the TPs between sequentially presented shapes. None of the chicks showed evidence for this ability. Conversely, we obtained strong evidence that newborn chicks encode the shapes of individual objects, showing that this automated method can produce robust results.

We conducted a pre-registered replication of the study of self-construal priming on spatial memory by Kühnen and Oyserman (2002; Study 2), simultaneously evaluating the role of task-compliance, operationalization specificity, and cross-cultural robustness. In the original study, participants either circled first-person plural (interdependent condition) or singular pronouns (independent condition) when reading a passage and subsequently memorized and recalled a set of objects presented on a visual-spatial grid. When employing a digital version of the original procedure, we were able to replicate the original findings, with better recall of objects in their original location in the interdependent (vs. independent) condition. Notably, the effect of self-construal priming on spatial memory was strongest when screening out participants who did not comply with instructions on the pronoun task and absent when including non-compliant participants. Moreover, in contrast to the original study, effects of priming were not specific to object-&-location operationalization of spatial memory recall, and also present for location-independent object recall and object-independent spatial placement recall. Additionally, condition effects were robust across observed cultural differences: Though white participants performing less successfully compared to non-white participants, both groups were comparably susceptible to priming effects.

The resulting dataset will serve as a resource for researchers and, through the analysis provided in this article, provide an important counterpoint to similar studies from elsewhere in Britain. The methodology of the project is presented, and the limitations of the data are discussed in detail. The principal difficulties were associated with dating the building and duration of use of individual structures, and the bias created by a few sites with large numbers of excavated structures. The analysis and interpretation of the data is presented in three sections: chronology, inhabitation and landscape, and historical overview. The emphasis on recently excavated sites with good chronological control has enabled a more confident reconstruction of the history of roundhouse occupation in Wales. This has shown that while the architectural form has relatively early origins with numbers beginning to grow after 1500 BC, it is primarily a feature of first millennium BC and early first millennium AD landscapes. During the first millennium BC, timber- and stone-built settlements are common, initially as enclosed sites, and later, by the Roman period, as both open and enclosed settlements. This is contrary to the situation in many other parts of Britain, where roundhouses and frequently field systems are dated to at least the mid-second millennium BC onwards. There were strong regional differences between regions at this time, with for instance the predominance of stone- and clay-built sites in north-west Wales and the absence of Roman period roundhouses in the north-east. The dataset derived from the project will remain as an important resource with which to research these regional differences in greater detail and to examine the implications of new fieldwork discoveries. It will also serve as a model for future synthesis of later prehistoric and early historic settlement architecture in Britain. The core data are available as a searchable database.

We employed a dual-target neurostimulation approach in 30 healthy participants, using cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to target two key nodes: lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), to test whether decision-making can be artificially shifted from habitual toward goal-directed control. Participants received three active stimulations, delivered at least six days apart (each involving 100 paired pulses over the IPS and LPFC, varying the interstimulus interval): two interventional, time-relevant ccPAS (10 msec interval) and one control, non-time-relevant ccPAS (100 msec interval). Following stimulation, participants completed a sequential learning task, measuring goal-directed/habitual control, and a working memory task. IPS→LPFC ccPAS (stimulating IPS, then LPFC with a 10 msec interval) shifted decision-making from habitual toward goal-directed control, compared to control ccPAS. There was no effect of LPFC→IPS ccPAS, nor an effect of any PAS condition on working memory. Previous studies have shown ccPAS effects outside the motor domain targeting prefrontal regions on response inhibition, attentional bias, and alpha asymmetry. The present study measures the behavioural effects of parietal-prefrontal PAS, focusing on a highly complex decision-making task and working memory. If confirmed in larger studies, this would be the first instance of neurostimulation successfully shifting decision-making from habitual to goal-directed control, putatively via inducing long-term potentiation between the IPS and LPFC.

It was hypothesized that adolescents who show more deviation from the classroom norm in personality experience more peer victimization. Data from 1108 adolescents (48% boys; Mage = 13.56 years, SD = 1.13) from 54 classrooms were used to test this hypothesis. Data included measurements of self?reported and bully?disclosed victimization and Big Five and Dark Triad personality traits. Results of generalized linear mixed models including polynomial equations and subsequent response surface analyses partly supported our hypothesis. Person?group dissimilarity in the shape of personality profiles was related to more bully?disclosed victimization, but not to self?reported victimization. Dissimilarity in neuroticism and Machiavellianism was related to both more self?reported and bully?disclosed victimization. Dissimilarity in extraversion, openness to experience, and psychopathy was only related to more self?reported victimization. Unexpectedly, dissimilarity in agreeableness was related to less self?reported victimization. Moreover, our results also indicated that certain levels of congruent person?group combinations in agreeableness, neuroticism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy were related to more peer victimization. Overall, findings of this study emphasize the importance of considering classroom norms in relation to peer victimization.

The Dual Hub account postulates that anterior temporal lobes (ATL) support taxonomic relationships based on shared physical features (mole – cat), while temporoparietal regions, including posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), support thematic associations (mole – earth). Conversely, the Controlled Semantic Cognition account proposes that ATL supports both aspects of knowledge, while left pMTG contributes to controlled retrieval. This study used magnetoencephalography to test these contrasting predictions of functional dissociations within the temporal lobe. ATL and pMTG responded more strongly to taxonomic and thematic trials respectively, matched for behavioural performance, in line with predictions of the Dual Hub account. In addition, ATL showed a greater response to strong than weak thematic associations, while pMTG showed the opposite pattern, supporting a key prediction of the Controlled Semantic Cognition account. ATL showed a stronger response for word pairs that were more semantically coherent, either because they shared physical features (in taxonomic trials) or a strong thematic association. These effects largely coincided in time and frequency (although an early oscillatory response in ATL was specific to taxonomic trials). In contrast, pMTG showed non-overlapping effects of semantic control demands and thematic judgements: this site showed a larger oscillatory response to weak associations, when ongoing retrieval needed to be shaped to suit the task demands, and also a larger response to thematic judgements contrasted with taxonomic trials (which was reduced but not eliminated when the thematic trials were easier). Consequently, time-sensitive neuroimaging supports a complex pattern of functional dissociations within the left temporal lobe, which reflects both coherence versus control and distinctive oscillatory responses for taxonomic overlap (in ATL) and thematic relations (in pMTG).",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:55:05Z,2020-01-30T11:12:48Z,2020-01-30T07:55:04Z,308-325,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,Dissociations in semantic cognition,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TKH38J2E\Teige et al. - 2019 - Dissociations in semantic cognition Oscillatory e.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HECTEFSP\S0010945219302540.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Semantic; Angular gyrus; Anterior temporal lobe; Controlled retrieval; MEG; Posterior middle temporal gyrus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000894

While social concepts have been associated to superior anterior temporal lobe (sATL), the neural correlates of quantity-related concepts have seldom been investigated. The right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is known to be involved in the processing of numerical information and of quantifiers. In the present study, we investigated the causal role of right sATL and right IPS in representing social and quantity-related concepts, using a state-dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-priming paradigm. We modulated the neural activation by priming to a category label (either SOCIAL or QUANTITY), before applying TMS and presenting the target (i.e., an exemplar of one of the two abstract classes). When the target word belonged to the quantity category, TMS applied over the IPS (but not sATL) abolished the expected priming effect by speeding up reaction times (RTs) in incongruent trials. For the social category, both IPS and sATL stimulation abolished the priming effect, by reducing RTs in incongruent trials. Our results suggest a specialization of distinct brain areas in processing different classes of abstract concepts. The right IPS contains neuronal representations tuned to quantity-related concepts, in line with its well-known role in numerical and magnitude representation.

This influence might result from two psychological factors—cost–benefit calculations and reactance-type processes. Both can be predicted to cause more deontological judgments for implausible compared to plausible moral dilemmas. In two experiments (total N = 417), dilemmas were modified to create a plausible and an implausible version without altering the actions and their alleged consequences.

Object-feature binding was assessed by applying probabilistic models to the joint distribution of feature errors: Feature reports for the same object could be correlated (and thus bound together) or independent. We found that splitting attention across multiple locations degrades object integrity, whereas rapid shifts of spatial attention maintain bound objects.

Individuals more frequently engaged in risky eating in their closer relationships than in their less close ones.

They then reported feelings of interpersonal closeness as well as chose how close to sit to their friend. Individuals who were randomly assigned to perceive they were engaging in high-risk eating behavior with a friend reported increased feelings of interpersonal closeness. Also, restrained eaters in the high-risk eating behavior condition reported greater feelings of interpersonal closeness while eating, which was mediated by increased feelings of activated positive affect (e.g., excited, alert).

With respect to environmental influences, a growing literature implicates intrauterine experiences in the origin of this pervasive developmental disorder. In this prospective longitudinal study, we examined the hypothesis that fetal exposure to maternal cortisol may confer ASD risk. In addition, because ASD is four times more prevalent in males than in females, and because sexually dimorphic responses to intrauterine experiences are commonly observed, we examined whether or not any associations differ by fetal sex. Maternal plasma cortisol was measured at 15, 19, 25, 31, and 37 weeks’ gestation in a sample of 84 pregnant women. ASD symptoms were assessed in their 5-year-old children with the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). Fetal exposure to lower levels of maternal cortisol was associated with higher levels of ASD symptoms only among boys. The observed hypocortisolemic profile exhibited by these mothers may indicate a risk factor that precedes the stress of caregiving for a child with ASD and may not be solely a consequence of the stress of caregiving, as previously thought. These findings confirm the value of examining prenatal hormone exposures as predictors of ASD risk and support the premise that altered prenatal steroid exposures may play a role in the etiology of ASD.",2019-03-01,2019-03-20T14:30:42Z,2019-03-20T14:30:49Z,2019-03-20T14:30:42Z,349-361,NA,2,7,NA,Clinical Psychological Science,Prenatal Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S3T4XBN8\Ram e.a. - 2019 - Prenatal Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) .pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000902

Two prokaryotic Roc-COR domains have been characterized as ?G proteins activated by guanine nucleotide-dependent dimerization? (GADs), which require dimerization for activation of their GTPase activity and bind guanine nucleotides with relatively low affinities. Additionally, LRRK2 Roc domain in isolation binds guanine nucleotides with relatively low affinities. As such, LRRK2 GTPase domain was predicted to be a GAD. Herein, we describe the design and high-level expression of human LRRK2 Roc-COR domain (LRRK2 Roc-COR). Biochemical analyses of LRRK2 Roc-COR reveal that it forms homodimers, with the C-terminal portion of COR mediating its dimerization. Furthermore, it co-purifies and binds Mg2+GTP/GDP at 1 : 1 stoichiometry, and it hydrolyzes GTP with Km and kcat of 22 nM and 4.70 ? 10?4 min?1, respectively. Thus, even though LRRK2 Roc-COR forms GAD-like homodimers, it exhibits conventional Ras-like GTPase properties, with high-affinity binding of Mg2+-GTP/GDP and low intrinsic catalytic activity. The PD-causative Y1699C mutation mapped to the COR domain was previously reported to reduce the GTPase activity of full-length LRRK2. In contrast, this mutation induces no change in the GTPase activity, and only slight perturbations in the secondary structure contents of LRRK2 Roc-COR. As this mutation does not directly affect the GTPase activity of the isolated Roc-COR tandem, it is possible that the effects of this mutation on full-length LRRK2 occur via other functional domains.

As chemosignals are a known medium for transferring negative emotions from a sender to a receiver, we examined whether chemosignals are also involved in the transmission of positive emotions. Positive emotions are important for overall well-being and yet relatively neglected in research on chemosignaling, arguably because of the stronger survival benefits linked with negative emotions. We observed that exposure to body odor collected from senders of chemosignals in a happy state induced a facial expression and perceptual-processing style indicative of happiness in the receivers of those signals.

This disruption can sustain, or aggravate, the epileptic condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activation of the kallikrein-kinin system in patients with TLE, as it relates to the maintenance of blood–brain barrier. Human hippocampal sclerotic tissues removed after surgery for seizure control, plasma, and serum were used in the following assays: immunostaining for white blood cells in the TLE hippocampus, C-reactive protein in serum, quantification of plasma kallikrein (PKal) and cathepsin B (CatB) activity in serum and plasma, quantification of C1-inhibitor, analysis of high-molecular-weight kininogen (H-kininogen) fragments, and activation of plasma prekallikrein for comparison with healthy controls. Infiltration of white blood cells in the sclerotic hippocampus and a significant increase in the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in the blood of TLE patients were observed. High levels of C-reactive protein (TLE = 1.4 ± 0.3 µg/mL), PKal (TLE = 5.4 ± 0.4 U/mL), and CatB (TLE = 4.9 ± 0.4 U/mL) were also evident in the serum of TLE patients comparing to controls. A strong linear correlation was observed between active CatB and PKal in the serum of TLE patients (r = 0.88). High levels of cleaved H-kininogen and free PKal, and low levels of C1-inhibitor (TLE = 188 ± 12 µg/mL) were observed in the serum of TLE patients. Our data demonstrated that the plasma kallikrein-kinin system is activated in patients with TLE.

The present studies tested the hypotheses that over time, negative, but not positive, group information would generalize to other group members (Experiment 1) and to the self (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, participants learned personal information about two members of two groups. Two members of one group were associated with negative trait information, while two members of the other group were associated with positive trait information. Participants then made trait and evaluative judgments about members of both groups. In Experiment 2, participants learned positive and negative information about their ingroup and an outgroup.

The present research examined, for the first time, whether the presence of a stigmatized outgroup expert whose stereotype content is similar to women's, but not a stigmatized outgroup experts whose stereotype content is dissimilar to women's, mitigates the cognitive interference stemming from identity threat for White women, and identifies a novel individual difference variable, stigma solidarity, which facilitates identification of such allies. Across six studies we demonstrated that White women perceived a Black male expert as less likely than White men to hold negative stereotypes about women's intelligence (Study 1, 2), especially if women were high in stigma solidarity (Study 3, 6), mitigating cognitive interference (Study 2, 4). Further, an outgroup expert who was not similarly stereotyped (i.e., Asian male) did not mitigate these identity threat effects (Study 5, 6). Thus, we contend that White women, especially those high in stigma solidarity, perceive similarly stereotyped outgroup experts as less likely to hold negative stereotypes about their intelligence, buffering against identity threats in such settings.

Demonization and desecration are negative spiritual appraisals associated with psychological maladjustment across political and relational contexts. Sanctification refers to the imbuing of persons, objects, or events with sacred qualities or as manifestations of a higher power. The authors examined the prevalence and role of spiritual appraisals related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election result on psychological adjustment and behaviors using a cross-sectional online sample of 252 American voters. Approximately one-fifth of participants sanctified the election of President Trump to some degree. Conversely, approximately one-third of participants endorsed some level of negative spiritual appraisals. Desecration and demonization also uniquely predicted maladjustment. Moreover, the interactive effect between vote and negative spiritual appraisals accounted for unique variance in maladjustment. At higher levels of demonization and desecration, those who voted for President Trump reported greater difficulties with emotion regulation than those who voted against President Trump. Negative spiritual appraisals also moderated the relations between vote and thought suppression, in addition to vote and information seeking behavior. For the small fraction of Trump voters with negative spiritual appraisals, their efforts to suppress misgivings, struggle with emotions, and seek information may be understood as attempts to reduce cognitive dissonance.",2019,2020-01-29T04:13:39Z,2020-01-29T04:14:06Z,2020-01-29T04:13:39Z,224-245,NA,1,19,NA,NA,The Hand of God or the Work of the Devil?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TQ9J7HKL\Wong et al. - 2019 - The Hand of God or the Work of the Devil Spiritua.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7N53X359\asap.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000917

To account for these findings, it has been proposed that exposure to expectancy-violating information enhances attention to context, which leads to an integration of the context into the representation of expectancy-violating counterattitudinal information. Although a considerable body of evidence supports these assumptions, it is still unclear whether contextualized attitude change is a general phenomenon that is robust across individuals or instead depends on psychological characteristics of the perceiver. To address this question, the current research tested whether contextualized attitude change is moderated by three individual difference variables that are known to influence responses to belief-incongruent information: preference for consistency, need for structure, and implicit theories of personality. Based on the hypothesis that contextualized attitude change is due to enhanced attention to context during encoding of expectancy-violating information, we hypothesized that individual differences along the three dimensions should moderate contextualized attitude change via differences in attention to context in response to expectancy-violating information. Contrary to this hypothesis, none of the three variables moderated contextualized attitude change (Experiments 1 and 2) and attention to context during exposure to expectancy-violating information (Experiment 3). Implications for the generality of contextualized attitude change, research on the three individual difference variables, and cognitive consistency more broadly are discussed.",2018-09-01,2019-03-30T16:42:28Z,2019-03-30T16:42:39Z,2019-03-30T16:42:28Z,148-161,NA,NA,78,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7D9YXEN4\Brannon en Gawronski - 2018 - Does contextualized attitude change depend on indi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2GSDG66K\S0022103117306595.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Attitude change; Context effects; Implicit theories of personality; Need for structure; Preference for consistency,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000919

Healthy participants (n = 74) completed measures of well-being in the lab and used a smartphone app to report their use of reappraisal and perceived controllability of their environment 10 times a day for 1 week. Results supported the strategy-situation-fit hypothesis. Participants with relatively high well-being used reappraisal more in situations they perceived as lower in controllability and less in situations they perceived as higher in controllability. In contrast, we found little evidence for an association between greater well-being and greater mean use of reappraisal across situations.",2016-12-01,2018-03-20T00:56:12Z,2018-04-04T00:38:24Z,2018-03-20T00:56:12Z,1651-1659,NA,12,27,NA,Psychol Sci,The Wisdom to Know the Difference,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TWEP4Q3L\Haines et al. - 2016 - The Wisdom to Know the Difference Strategy-Situat.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000924

For example, an oft-documented finding is that citizens tend to view the state of the national economy more positively if their party holds office. These partisan perceptual gaps are usually taken as a result of citizens' own motivated reasoning to defend their party identity. However, little is known about the extent to which perceptual gaps are shaped by one of the most important forces in politics: partisan elites. With two studies focusing on perceptions of the economy—a quasi-experimental panel study and a randomized experiment—we show how partisan perceptual differences are substantially affected by messages coming from party elites.

Prior studies have focused mainly on typicality’s influence on attractiveness, although recent studies have cast doubt on its importance for attractiveness judgments. Here, we argue that face typicality is an important factor for social perception because it affects trustworthiness judgments, which approximate the basic evaluation of faces. This effect has been overlooked because trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments have a high level of shared variance for most face samples. We show that for a continuum of faces that vary on a typicality-attractiveness dimension, trustworthiness judgments peak around the typical face. In contrast, perceived attractiveness increases monotonically past the typical face, as faces become more like the most attractive face. These findings suggest that face typicality is an important determinant of face evaluation.",2015-01-01,2018-03-20T23:53:49Z,2018-03-20T23:54:52Z,2018-03-20T23:53:48Z,39-47,NA,1,26,NA,Psychol Sci,What Is Typical Is Good,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZPHEJFZC\Sofer et al. - 2015 - What Is Typical Is Good The Influence of Face Typ.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000929

We investigated whether emotional value can affect nonhuman primates’ processing of stimuli that are only mentally represented, not visually available. In a short-term memory task, baboons memorized the location of two target squares of the same color, which were presented with a distractor of a different color. Through prior long-term conditioning, one of the two colors had acquired a negative valence. Subjects were slower and less accurate on the memory task when the targets were negative than when they were neutral. In contrast, subjects were faster and more accurate when the distractors were negative than when they were neutral. Some of these effects were modulated by individual differences in emotional disposition. Overall, the results reveal a pattern of cognitive avoidance of negative stimuli, and show that emotional value alters cognitive processing in baboons even when the stimuli are not physically present. This suggests that emotional influences on cognition are deeply rooted in evolutionary continuity.",2017-01-01,2018-03-20T00:48:05Z,2018-03-20T00:48:12Z,2018-03-20T00:48:05Z,3-11,NA,1,28,NA,Psychol Sci,Emotion-Cognition Interaction in Nonhuman Primates,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\C4ZJL2CS\Blanchette et al. - 2017 - Emotion-Cognition Interaction in Nonhuman Primates.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000931

The perceptual asymmetry theory predicted that stimuli in the lower visual field would be processed more fluently and would therefore be perceived as more familiar. The working memory theory, originally proposed in space–number research, envisaged type-specific spatial patterns for different stimuli. Participants made old/new recognition memory judgements for stimuli, presented at random positions, while their eye movements were recorded. The observed spatial patterns changed according to the stimulus type (e.g., “more left = older” for horizontally written words and “upper = older” for vertically written words), and this flexibility is encapsulated by the working memory theory as follows: (a) stimulus-type-specific spatial configurations are encoded in long-term memory on the basis of one’s experience (e.g., vertically written words are empirically associated with the “upper = older” spatial configuration), (b) the presentation of a stimulus automatically cues the temporal activation of the associated spatial configuration in working memory, and (c) the referential process between the stimulus and configuration unconsciously affects the viewer’s sense of familiarity.",2019-04-01,2019-04-05T15:04:35Z,2019-04-05T15:04:54Z,2019-04-05T15:04:35Z,832-846,NA,4,72,NA,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,Systematic spatial patterns of the sense of familiarity,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\P29S6DS3\Miyoshi and Ashida - 2019 - Systematic spatial patterns of the sense of famili.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000937

Eight times a day, electronic devices prompted subjects to report on their current thoughts and context. Working memory capacity and attention abilities predicted subjects’ TUT rates in the lab, but predicted the frequency of daily-life mind wandering only as a function of subjects’ momentary attempts to concentrate. This pattern replicates prior daily-life findings but conflicts with laboratory findings. Results for personality factors also revealed different associations in the lab and daily life: Only neuroticism predicted TUT rate in the lab, but only openness predicted mind-wandering rate in daily life (both predicted the content of daily-life mind wandering). Cognitive and personality factors also predicted dimensions of everyday thought other than mind wandering, such as subjective judgments of controllability of thought.

The reported experience of involuntariness is central to hypnotic responding, during which strategic action is experienced as involuntary. We report reduced intentional binding in a hypnotically induced experience of involuntariness, providing an objective correlate of reports of involuntariness. We argue that this reduced binding results from the diminished influence of motor intentions in the generation of the sense of agency when beliefs about whether an action is intended are altered.

We suggest that this is likely due to an overemphasis of the role of motor aspects of arm movement in these effects. The goal of this research is therefore to reevaluate the role of sensorimotor information in the production of compatibility effects by suggesting that large and replicable effects can be observed when the task simulates the visual information that comes with whole-body movements. In line with this idea, we present six experiments showing that such a task (the Visual Approach/Avoidance by the Self Task; VAAST) can produce large and replicable compatibility effects. Importantly, these experiments also test the core aspects producing these effects. These experiments reassert the role of sensorimotor information in the production of approach/avoidance compatibility effects.

Overall, errors were more similar within the same gestalt-defined groups than between different gestalt-defined groups, such that the remembered sizes of individual circles were biased toward the mean size of their respective gestalt-defined groups.

In this study, we examined the associations among repetitive negative thinking, positive reappraisal, and individual symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. Models of regularized partial-correlation networks were estimated using cross-sectional data from 468 participants. Results showed that repetitive negative thinking and positive reappraisal were differentially related to affective, cognitive, and somatic symptoms of depression and anxiety. Moreover, repetitive negative thinking was more central than positive reappraisal with stronger connections to individual symptoms. Finally, repetitive negative thinking was more important than positive reappraisal in connecting clusters of depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings cast light on potential pathways through which repetitive negative thinking and positive reappraisal may operate within depression and anxiety.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T05:34:04Z,2020-01-30T05:34:13Z,2020-01-30T05:34:04Z,1304-1318,NA,6,7,NA,Clinical Psychological Science,Emotion Regulation Difficulties Related to Depression and Anxiety,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LQMRWUCY\Everaert and Joormann - 2019 - Emotion Regulation Difficulties Related to Depress.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,depression; network analysis; open data; emotion regulation; anxiety; positive reappraisal; repetitive negative thinking,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000948

We explored the relationship between body shapes and body descriptions and showed that a small number of words can be used to generate categorically accurate representations of three-dimensional bodies. The dimensions of body-shape variation that emerged in a language-based similarity space were related to major dimensions of variation computed directly from three-dimensional laser scans of 2,094 bodies. This relationship allowed us to generate three-dimensional models of people in the shape space using only their coordinates on analogous dimensions in the language-based description space.

This implicitly learned anticipatory behavior depends on the past performance of repeated sensorimotor interactions timed with external cues. This kind of predictive behavior has been shown to be compromised in neurological disorders such as Huntington disease (HD), in which neural atrophy includes key cortical and basal ganglia regions. To investigate the neural basis of the anticipatory behavioral deficits in HD we used a predictive-saccade paradigm that requires predictive control to generate saccades in a metronomic temporal pattern. This is ideal because the integrity of the oculomotor network that includes the striatum and prefrontal, parietal, occipital and temporal cortices can be analyzed using structural MRI. Our results showed that the HD patients had severe predictive saccade deficits (i.e., an inability to reduce saccade reaction time in predictive condition), which are accentuated in patients with more severe motor deterioration. Structural imaging analyses revealed that these anticipatory deficits correlated with grey-matter atrophy in frontal, parietal-occipital and striatal regions. These findings indicate that the predictive saccade control deficits in HD are related to an extended cortico-striatal atrophy. This suggests that eye movement measurement could be a reliable marker of the progression of cognitive deficits in HD.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:11:18Z,2020-01-30T12:02:35Z,2020-01-30T08:11:18Z,89-103,NA,NA,121,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DSQ9LRCD\Vaca-Palomares et al. - 2019 - Implicit learning impairment identified via predic.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V9SU4UHW\S0010945219302515.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bio-marker; Fronto-parietal cortex; Grey-matter atrophy; Implicit learning; Motor deterioration; Predictive saccades; Striatum,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000953

This theory predicts that individuals with low transferable skills in the labor market will articulate a subjective sense of job insecurity and higher hostility toward migrants. Our cross-classified, longitudinal, and difference-in-differences models reveal that skill specificity is a strong driver of anti-immigrant attitudes, and they suggest that economic competition theories cannot be dismissed.

First, we examined all nonsignificant findings mentioned in the abstracts of the 2015 volumes of Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, and Psychological Science (N = 137). In 72% of these cases, nonsignificant results were misinterpreted, in that the authors inferred that the effect was absent.

Federal laws have shaped policies addressing sexual assault in higher education. Title IX guidance requires universities to designate “Responsible Employees,” who are required to report all sexual assaults they learn about to the university (even if the survivor does not want to report). Resident assistants (RAs) are an important source of support for students and increasingly designated as Responsible Employees. University mandatory reporting policies have significant implications for reporters’ and survivors’ lives, but there is a lack of research on how Responsible Employees perceive this role. The current study examined Responsible Employee RA perceptions of mandatory reporting, the relationship between RAs’ experience of college sexual assault and perceptions of mandatory reporting, and whether trust in university response to sexual assault mediates this relationship. Data from 305 Responsible Employee RAs were analyzed. RAs’ perceptions of their reporting role were varied. For instance, RAs believed that mandatory reporting complicates their other responsibilities. College sexual assault survivors had less trust in university response to sexual assault, which, in turn, predicted more negative perceptions of mandatory reporting. Responsible Employees’ perceptions of mandatory reporting offer valuable insight into the potential effectiveness and drawbacks of these policies.",2019,2020-01-29T04:11:59Z,2020-01-29T04:12:20Z,2020-01-29T04:11:59Z,133-149,NA,1,19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UFR5HRZD\Holland - 2019 - Examining Responsible Employees’ Perceptions of Se.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4XCYW8HR\asap.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000962

However, this assumption holds only in cases in which competing causes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (i.e., exactly one cause is true). We argue that this reasoning error is due to a zero-sum perspective on evidence, wherein people assume that evidence that supports one causal hypothesis must disconfirm its competitor.

On the one hand, the difficulty of using a foreign language might slow people down and increase deliberation, amplifying utilitarian considerations of maximizing welfare. On the other hand, use of a foreign language might stunt emotional processing, attenuating considerations of deontological rules, such as the prohibition against killing. Using a process-dissociation technique, we found that foreign-language use decreases deontological responding but does not increase utilitarian responding.

These models seek to infer word representations from large text collections by predicting target words from neighbouring words (or vice versa). The resulting representations are vectors in a continuous space, collectively called word embeddings. Although psychological plausibility was not a primary concern for the developers of predictive models, it has been the topic of several recent studies in the field of psycholinguistics. That is, word embeddings have been linked to similarity ratings, word associations, semantic priming, word recognition latencies, and so on. Here, we build on this work by investigating category structure. Throughout seven experiments, we sought to predict human typicality judgements from two languages, Dutch and English, using different semantic spaces. More specifically, we extracted a number of predictor variables, and evaluated how well they could capture the typicality gradient of common categories (e.g., birds, fruit, vehicles, etc.). Overall, the performance of predictive models was rather modest and did not compare favourably with that of an older count-based model. These results are somewhat disappointing given the enthusiasm surrounding predictive models.

We find that naturalization rates surged by about 60% once politicians rather than citizens began deciding on naturalization applications. Whereas voters in referendums face no cost of arbitrarily rejecting qualified applicants based on discriminatory preferences, politicians in the council are constrained to formally justify rejections and may be held accountable by judicial review.

Discussion of the Newtown shootings in 2012 reflected a dynamic process, beginning as a national conversation before transforming into a polarized exchange.

We propose to clarify the link between self?worth and ideology by distinguishing between narcissistic and non?narcissistic self?evaluations as well as between different dimensions of ideological attitudes. Four studies, conducted in three different socio?political contexts: the UK (Study 1, N = 422), the US (Studies 2 and 3, Ns = 471 and 289, respectively), and Poland (Study 4, N = 775), investigated the associations between narcissistic and non?narcissistic self?evaluations, social dominance orientation (SDO), right?wing authoritarianism (RWA), and ethnic prejudice. Confirming our hypotheses, the results consistently showed that after controlling for self?esteem, narcissistic self?evaluation was positively associated with SDO (accounting for RWA), yet negatively associated with RWA (accounting for SDO). These associations were similar after controlling for psychopathy and Machiavellianism (Study 3) as well as collective narcissism and Big Five personality characteristics (Study 4). Studies 2?4 additionally demonstrated that narcissistic self?evaluation was indirectly positively associated with prejudice through higher SDO (free of RWA) but indirectly negatively associated with prejudice through lower RWA (free of SDO). Implications for understanding the role of self?evaluation in right?wing ideological attitudes and prejudice are discussed. Copyright ? 2017 The Authors.

Using a psychopharmacogenetic approach, we found that testosterone increases aggression in men (N = 308) with select personality profiles and that these effects are further enhanced among those with fewer cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene, a polymorphism associated with increased AR efficiency. Testosterone’s effects were rapid (~30 min after administration) and mediated, in part, by subjective reward associated with aggression. Testosterone thus appears to promote human aggression through an AR-related mechanism and to have stronger effects in men with the select personality profiles because it more strongly upregulates the subjective pleasure they derive from aggression. Given other evidence that testosterone regulates reward through dopaminergic pathways, and that the sensitivity of such pathways is enhanced among individuals with the personality profiles we identified, our findings may also implicate dopaminergic processes in testosterone’s heterogeneous effects on aggression.",2019-04-01,2020-01-29T05:37:43Z,2020-01-29T05:37:55Z,2020-01-29T05:37:43Z,481-494,NA,4,30,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BX3I4L7T\Geniole et al. - 2019 - Using a Psychopharmacogenetic Approach To Identify.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,aggression; testosterone; open data; androgen receptor; dopamine; nongenomic; reward,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000976

Counter to the typical strategy of choice diversification, findings from four studies demonstrated that the presence of romantically unfavorable sex ratios (those featuring more same-sex than opposite-sex individuals) led heterosexual people to diversify financial resources less and instead concentrate investment in high-risk/high-return options when making lottery, stock-pool, retirement-account, and research-funding decisions.

In a now seminal study, Zajonc, Heingartner, and Herman (ZHH) (1969) demonstrated that the audience effect of social facilitation was exhibited in the Blatta orientalis cockroach: cockroaches were faster to complete a simple task (traversing a runway) when among other cockroaches than when alone, yet slower when the task was complex (traversing a maze). This finding suggested that arousal was a likely driver of social facilitation in the cockroach (since self-aware mechanisms were unlikely to apply). It also invited consideration of the possibility that arousal may be a contributing factor to social facilitation in humans.

But we know little about how people form these ideas about their likes and dislikes in the first place, in part because of a dearth of paradigms that enable researchers to experimentally change people's attribute preferences. Drawing on theory and methods in covariation detection and social cognition, we developed a paradigm that examines how people infer summarized preferences for novel attributes from functional attribute preferences: the extent to which the attribute predicts an individual's evaluations across multiple targets (e.g., a person's tendency to positively evaluate mates who are more vs. less attractive). In three studies, participants encountered manipulated information about their own functional preference for a novel attribute in a set of targets. They then inferred a summarized preference for the attribute. Summarized preferences corresponded strongly to the functional preference manipulation when targets varied on only one attribute. But additional complexity (in the form of a second novel attribute) caused summarized and functional preferences to diverge, and biases emerged: Participants reported stronger summarized preferences for the attribute when the population of targets possessed more of the attribute on average (regardless of functional preference strength).

After-effects on pointing without feedback to a visual target (open loop pointing – OLP) are traditionally described as being larger than those measured by straight ahead pointing (SAP) with eyes closed, and the difference between them is attributed to a shift in visual localisation. However, neither differences between OLP and SAP, nor shifts in perceptual judgement of visual straight ahead (VSA), are consistently reported. Moreover, since very few studies have directly recorded direction of gaze, an effect of PA on the state estimate of gaze direction has not been reliably documented. The current research aimed to isolate the effects of PA on state estimates of eye position. We measured sensorimotor after-effects through common (OLP, SAP, and VSA) measures, and also recorded eye position and additional after-effect measures to interrogate changes to the oculomotor system and how these might relate to other measures of sensorimotor change. To ascertain if PA's effects on estimates of eye position could be attributed to eye muscle potentiation, we compared the effects of PA to sustained gaze deviation without adaptation. PA induced no effect on visual straight-ahead and no change in direction of gaze, when measured while positioning a target, looking straight ahead in the dark, or looking toward the passively positioned and occluded unexposed hand. We also found that after-effects measured by SAP with the eyes open were larger than SAP with the eyes closed and equal to those observed with OLP. The findings challenge the concept that total adaptation after-effect is a direct sum of arm proprioceptive and visual after-effects as conventionally measured, and suggest that the oculomotor system is altered by prism adaptation only in interaction with an arm motor command when vision is available.",2019-06-01,2020-01-30T06:59:54Z,2020-01-30T07:00:20Z,2020-01-30T06:59:53Z,246-263,NA,NA,115,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UL8HJWNE\Gilligan et al. - 2019 - The effect of prism adaptation on state estimates .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7CV9SZEV\S0010945219300590.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Prism adaptation; Eye position; Proprioception; Visual shift,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000984

The present study addressed the possibility that opening gambit expectations, from the perspective of the recipient, would be impacted by the approaching individuals’ physical appearance, specifically their facial attractiveness.

Therefore, alternative strategies, such as retrograde coronary venous infusion (RCVI), are explored. The aim of this confirmatory study was to compare cardiac cell retention between RCVI and IC infusion. As a secondary end point, the procedural safety of RCVI is assessed. Methods Four weeks after myocardial infarction, 12 pigs were randomised to receive mesenchymal stromal cells, labelled with Indium-111, via RCVI (n=6) or IC infusion (n=6). Four hours after cell administration, nuclear imaging was performed to determine the number of cells retained in the heart both in vivo and ex vivo. Procedure-related safety measures were reported. Results Cardiac cell retention is significantly lower after RCVI compared with IC infusion (in vivo: RCVI: median 2.89% vs IC: median 13.74%, p=0.002, ex vivo: RCVI: median 2.55% vs IC: median 39.40%, p=0.002). RCVI led to development of pericardial fluid and haematomas on the frontal wall of the heart in three cases. Coronary venous dissection after RCVI was seen in three pigs, of which one also developed pericardial fluid and a haematoma. IC infusion led to no flow in one pig. Conclusion RCVI is significantly less efficient in delivering cells to the heart compared with IC infusion. RCVI led to more procedure-related safety issues than IC infusion, with multiple cases of venous dissection and development of haematomas and pericardial fluid collections.",2019-01-01,2020-01-28T06:47:10Z,2020-01-28T06:47:40Z,2020-01-28T06:47:10Z,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The discussion is intended as a provocative introduction to the archaeology of highland Chiriqui rather than an exhaustive exploration, and seeks to convey the contemporary context of an understudied archaeological region. Chiriqui, like the isthmus of Panama overall, inhabits a nebulous place in archaeological conception due to its positioning below Mesoamerica and above the Andean world. This academic displacement is further complicated  or potentially prompted  by the de-contextualisation of vast quantities of pre-Columbian artefacts in the late 19th century, after large cemeteries were discovered in 1859 and then subjected to several decades of intensive excavation by individuals seeking monetary gain, adventure, or both from the experience. Antiquities removed from Chiriqui at this time were transported to museum collections throughout the western world. While the removed artefacts attest to the richness of pre-Columbian material culture, the sites from which they came were effectively erased from the landscape and archaeological conception. I draw from diverse, ephemeral and cartographically imprecise sources of information provided by accounts from looters and adventurers, antiquarian reports, museum accession files, and rumour to extrapolate possible locations for looted sites that provided the materials held in the major museum collections. I place these 'un-firm' locations in a GIS in conjunction with precisely located sites from systematic survey to show how they relate to one another. A concomitant role of this article is to make data from fieldwork I conducted between 2000 and 2005 in highland Chiriqui accessible to other researchers. In this article, I tease out one particular grave and the materials used to construct it from these data as synecdoche for myriad thousands of looted Chiriqui graves as well as the archaeological need to seek new forms of data.",2010,2018-04-05T07:04:08Z,2018-04-05T07:05:11Z,2018-04-05T07:04:08Z,NA,NA,28,NA,NA,Internet Archaeol.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"Upon subscription, fair use of all material published in the journal is permitted, providing that adequate citation is included. http://intarch.ac.uk/terms.html provides a statement of rights for this resource.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\K6PDR3GW\holmberg_index.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2014,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000994

However, less is known about the lexical and morphological cues that may modulate Mandarin speakers’ sensitivity to English number agreement. To investigate this, we examined subject-verb agreement processing in English by L1 Mandarin participants using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and focused on the use of quantificational cues to noun number and their interaction with agreement morphology on the verb. Previous work in English monolinguals has shown that agreement violations elicited larger P600s when preceded by a plurally quantified subject noun phrase (NP) compared to an unquantified NP. In the present study, Mandarin speakers were tested on the same quantified and unquantified sentences (e.g., Most/The cookies taste/*tastes…) as in the prior work. Like the L1 English speakers, ERPs time-locked to the verb showed a reliable P600 in response to agreement violations. However, the P600 in Mandarin speakers was larger for ungrammatical verbs with unquantified subjects, a contrast with English monolinguals. First, these results demonstrate that L2 agreement violations can elicit qualitatively similar neural responses in L1 Mandarin speakers as in English monolinguals (P600 effects), a finding that is to our knowledge novel. Second, quantification modulated the P600 in the L2 speakers in a qualitatively different way than in natives. Overall, these findings suggest stronger reliance on lexical versus morphological cues to number in Mandarin speakers, and that this impacts anticipation of subsequent grammatical features.",2018-12,2020-01-28T06:01:16Z,2020-01-28T06:02:34Z,2020-01-28T06:01:16Z,731-754,NA,4,40,NA,NA,QUANTIFICATIONAL CUES MODULATE THE PROCESSING OF ENGLISH SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT BY NATIVE CHINESE SPEAKERS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cambridge Core,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CWQ7G3W7\Armstrong et al. - 2018 - QUANTIFICATIONAL CUES MODULATE THE PROCESSING OF E.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JMX4MKDG\9347CFC07BF9549EC637D0CF976C008C.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000995

The relationship between body-ownership and the sense of agency has been described by different neurocognitive models, each providing specific neurofunctional predictions. According to an “additive” model, the sense of agency entails body-ownership, while an alternative “independence” hypothesis suggests that they represent two qualitatively different processes, underpinned by distinct brain systems. We propose a third “interactive” model, arguing the interdependence between body-ownership and the sense of agency: these constructs might represent different experiences with specific and exclusive brain correlates, but they also could partly overlap at the neurofunctional level. Here we test these three neurocognitive models by reviewing the available neurofunctional literature of body-ownership and the sense of agency, with a quantitative meta-analytical approach that allowed us to compare their neural correlates statistically. We identified (i) a body-ownership-specific network including the left inferior parietal lobule and the left extra-striate body area, (ii) a sense-of-agency-specific network including the left SMA, the left posterior insula, the right postcentral gyrus, and the right superior temporal lobe and (iii) a shared network in the left middle insula. These results provide support for the interactive neurocognitive model of body-ownership and the sense of agency. Body-ownership involves a sensory network in which multisensory inputs are integrated to be self-attributed. On the other hand, the sense of agency is specifically associated with premotor and sensory-motor areas, typically involved in generating motor predictions and in action monitoring. Finally, body-ownership and the sense of agency interact at the level of the left middle insula, a high-level multisensory hub engaged in body and action awareness in general.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:10:37Z,2020-01-30T12:01:54Z,2020-01-30T08:10:37Z,169-178,NA,NA,121,NA,Cortex,Neurofunctional correlates of body-ownership and sense of agency,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\SP6BNGKP\Seghezzi et al. - 2019 - Neurofunctional correlates of body-ownership and s.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7HL8XVQM\S0010945219303077.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Meta-analysis; Motor control; Body-ownership; Self-awareness; Sense of agency,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a000996

People prefer saving leisure for last, believing they would otherwise be distracted by looming work (Study 1). In controlled experiments, however, although subjects thought their enjoyment would be spoiled when they played a game before rather than after a laborious problem-solving task, got a massage before rather than after midterms, and consumed snacks and watched videos before rather than after a stressful performance, in reality these experiences were similarly enjoyable regardless of order (Studies 2 through 4). This misprediction was indeed mediated by anticipated distraction and was therefore attenuated after people were reminded of the absorbing nature of enjoyable activities (Studies 3 and 4). These studies highlight the power of hedonic experience within the moment of consumption, which has implications for managing (or mismanaging) everyday work and leisure.

To compare chronic damage and deficits following increasing numbers of repeated mTBIs, a closed-head weight-drop model of repeated mTBI was used to deliver 1, 2 or 3 mTBIs to adult female rats at 24 h intervals. Outcomes were assessed at 3 months following the first mTBI. No gross motor, sensory or reflex deficits were identified (p > 0.05), consistent with current literature. Cognitive function assessed using a Morris water maze revealed chronic memory deficits following 1 and 2, but not 3 mTBI compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05). Oxidative damage to DNA was assessed immunohistochemically in the dentate hilus of the hippocampus and splenium of the corpus callosum; no changes were observed. IBA1-positive microglia were increased in size in the cortex following 1 mTBI and in the corpus callosum following 2 mTBI compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05); no changes were observed in the dentate hilus. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocyte immunoreactivity was assessed in all three brain regions and no chronic changes were observed. Integrity of myelin ultrastructure in the corpus callosum was assessed using transmission electron microscopy. G ratio was decreased following 2 mTBIs compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05) at post hoc level only. The changing patterns of damage and deficits following increasing numbers of mTBI may reflect dynamic responses to small numbers of mTBIs or a conditioning effect such that increasing numbers of mTBIs do not necessarily result in worsening pathology.

Existing work in this area has focused on situations in which the target’s trustworthiness is relevant to the judgment (e.g., criminal verdicts and economic games). Yet in the present studies, we found that people also overgeneralized trustworthiness in criminal-sentencing decisions when trustworthiness should not be judicially relevant, and they did so even for the most extreme sentencing decision: condemning someone to death. In Study 1, we found that perceptions of untrustworthiness predicted death sentences (vs. life sentences) for convicted murderers in Florida (N = 742). Moreover, in Study 2, we found that the link between trustworthiness and the death sentence occurred even when participants viewed innocent people who had been exonerated after originally being sentenced to death.

Overall, 87% of the replication attempts were statistically significant in the expected direction.

This effect reverses at longer intervals, giving rise to Inhibition of Return (IOR). The integration-segregation hypothesis (Lupiáñez, 2010) suggests that peripheral cues always produce an onset-detection cost regardless the behavioral cueing effect that is measured – either facilitation or IOR. In the present study, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the causal contribution of this detection cost to performance. We used a cueing paradigm with a target discrimination task that was preceded by a non-informative peripheral cue. The presence-absence of a central intervening event was manipulated. Online TMS to the left superior parietal lobe (compared to an active vertex stimulation) lead to an overall more positive effect (faster responses for cued as compared to uncued trials), by putatively impairing the detection cost contribution to performance. The data revealed a strong association between overall RT and the TMS effect, and also between overall RT and the integrity of the first branch of the left superior longitudinal fascicule.

In the current study, we examined the time course of spatially specific alpha activity after central cues and during visual search.

Participants (46% male; mean age = 42 years, SD = 11) completed the 200?item HEXACO Personality Inventory?Revised either as part of a job application (n = 1613) or as part of low?stakes research (n = 1613). A comprehensive set of invariance tests were performed. Applicants scored higher than non?applicants on honesty?humility (d = 0.86), extraversion (d = 0.73), agreeableness (d = 1.06), and conscientiousness (d = 0.77). The bifactor model provided improved model fit relative to a standard correlated factor model, and loadings on the evaluative factor of the bifactor model were highly correlated with other indicators of item social desirability. The bifactor model explained approximately two?thirds of the differences between applicants and non?applicants. Results suggest that rather than being a higher order construct, the general factor of personality may be caused by an item?level evaluative process. Results highlight the importance of modelling data at the item?level. Implications for conceptualizing social desirability, higher order structures in personality, test development, and job applicant faking are discussed.

Results across two studies support prior findings regarding Solomon’s paradox: Participants (N = 623) more strongly endorsed wise-reasoning strategies (e.g., intellectual humility, adopting an outsider’s perspective) for resolving other people’s social conflicts than for resolving their own. The pursuit of virtue (e.g., pursuing personal ideals and contributing to other people) moderated this effect of conflict type. In both studies, greater endorsement of the pursuit of virtue was associated with greater endorsement of wise-reasoning strategies for one’s own personal conflicts; as a result, participants who highly endorsed the pursuit of virtue endorsed wise-reasoning strategies at similar levels for resolving their own social conflicts and resolving other people’s social conflicts.

How do such arrangements influence the linkage between public opinion and policy outputs?

This claim is tested using a novel data set of policy change in the European Union (EU), covering 211 policy issues and 6,506 observations of opinion–policy dyads. Results show that measures weighting opinion across member states by how much national citizens care about an issue are better predictors of policy change than EU-wide mean opinion. Moreover, congruence between state-level opinion and EU-level policy becomes more likely, the more salient and clear-cut opinion in a member state is.

Dysfunction in dopaminergic neurotransmission within the striatum leads to movement impairments, gaiting defects, and hypo-locomotion. Due to their high polarity and extreme axonal arborization, neurons depend on molecular motor proteins and microtubule-based transport for their normal function. Transport defects have been associated with neurodegeneration since axonopathies, axonal clogging, microtubule destabilization, and lower motor proteins levels were described in the brain of patients with Parkinson's Disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, the contribution of specific motor proteins to the regulation of the nigrostriatal network remains unclear. Here, we generated different conditional knockout mice for the kinesin heavy chain 5B subunit (Kif5b) of Kinesin-1 to unravel its contribution to locomotion. Interestingly, mice with neuronal Kif5b deletion showed hypo-locomotion, movement initiation deficits, and coordination impairments. High pressure liquid chromatography determined that dopamine (DA) metabolism is impaired in neuronal Kif5b-KO, while no dopaminergic cell loss was observed. However, the deletion of Kif5b only in dopaminergic neurons is not sufficient to induce locomotor defects. Noteworthy, pharmacological stimulation of DA release together with agonist or antagonist of DA receptors revealed selective D2-dependent movement initiation defects in neuronal Kif5b-KO. Finally, subcellular fractionation from striatum showed that Kif5b deletion reduced the amount of dopamine D2 receptor in synaptic plasma membranes. Together, these results revealed an important role for Kif5b in the modulation of the striatal network that is relevant to the overall locomotor response.

Whether assessed or experimentally induced, a fixed theory was more likely to dampen interest in areas outside people’s existing interests (Studies 1–3). Individuals endorsing a fixed theory were also more likely to anticipate boundless motivation when passions were found, not anticipating possible difficulties (Study 4).

In contrast, we found that providing affective forecasters with social-category information about their targets made their forecasts more extreme and therefore less accurate. In both political and sports contexts, forecasters across five experiments exhibited greater impact bias for both in-group and out-group members (e.g., a Democrat or Republican) than for unspecified targets when predicting experiencers’ responses to positive and negative events. Inducing time pressure reduced the extremity of forecasts for group-labeled but not unspecified targets, which suggests that the increased impact bias was due to overcorrection for social-category information, not different intuitive predictions for identified targets.

Compared with forward planning, backward planning not only led to greater motivation, higher goal expectancy, and less time pressure but also resulted in better goal-relevant performance. We further demonstrated that this motivational effect occurred because backward planning allowed people to think of tasks required to reach their goals more clearly, especially when goals were complex to plan.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels expressed at peripheral nerve endings, including TRP subtypes ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), can detect nociceptive stimuli. In this study, we determined the contribution of presynaptic TRPA1 and TRPV1 at the spinal cord level to regulating nociceptive drive in chronic inflammatory pain induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in rats. CFA treatment caused a large increase in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in lamina I, but not lamina II outer zone, dorsal horn neurons. However, blocking NMDA receptors had no effect on spontaneous EPSCs in lamina I neurons of CFA-treated rats. Application of a specific TRPA1 antagonist, AM-0902, or of a specific TRPV1 antagonist, 5′-iodoresiniferatoxin, significantly attenuated the elevated frequency of spontaneous EPSCs and miniature EPSCs, the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs evoked from the dorsal root in lamina I neurons of CFA-treated rats. AM-0902 and 5′-iodoresiniferatoxin had no effect on evoked or miniature EPSCs in lamina I neurons of vehicle-treated rats. In addition, intrathecal injection of AM-0902 or 5′-iodoresiniferatoxin significantly reduced pain hypersensitivity in CFA-treated rats but had no effect on acute nociception in vehicle-treated rats. Therefore, unlike neuropathic pain, chronic inflammatory pain is associated with NMDA receptor–independent potentiation in glutamatergic drive to spinal lamina I neurons. Endogenous presynaptic TRPA1 and TRPV1 activity at the spinal level contributes to increased nociceptive input from primary sensory nerves to dorsal horn neurons in inflammatory pain.

Here, we demonstrated that risk taking increases in people who are not explicitly aware they are wearing protective equipment; furthermore, this happens for behaviors that could not be made safer by that equipment.

The violation of distributional assumptions can result in consequences ranging from small changes to error rates through to substantially biased estimates and parameters fundamentally losing their intended interpretations. Conventionally, researchers have conducted assumption checks after collecting data, and then changed the primary analysis technique if violations of distributional assumptions are observed. An approach to dealing with distributional assumptions that requires decisions to be made contingent on observed data is problematic, however, in preregisteredresearch, where researchers attempt to specify all important analysis decisions prior to collecting data. Limited methodological advice is currently available regarding how to deal with the prospect of distributional assumption violations in preregistered research. In this article, we examine several strategies that researchers could use in preregistrations to reduce the potential impact of distributional assumption violations. We suggest that pre-emptively selecting analysis methods that are as robust as possible to assumption violations, performing planned robustness analyses, and/or supplementing preregistered confirmatory analyses with exploratory checks of distributional assumptions may all be useful strategies. On the other hand, we suggest that prespecifying “decision trees” for selecting data analysis methods based on the distributional characteristics of the data may not be practical in most situations.",2019-09-12,2020-01-29T08:02:56Z,2020-01-29T08:03:13Z,2020-01-29T08:02:56Z,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"Copyright (c) 2019 Matt N Williams, Casper Albers",NA,NA,NA,open.lnu.se,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5287VKPZ\Williams and Albers - 2019 - Dealing with Distributional Assumptions in Preregi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J3NVKACI\1592.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,open science; transparency; preregistrations; statistical assumptions,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001025

In the current study, we use a network science approach to examine if the organization of semantic memory differs between high and low groups of openness to experience. A sample of 516 adults completed measures of openness to experience (from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 and Big Five Aspect Scales) and a semantic verbal fluency task. Next, the sample was split into half to form high (n = 258) and low (n = 258) openness to experience groups. Semantic networks were then constructed on the basis of their verbal fluency responses. Our results revealed that the high openness to experience group's network was more interconnected, flexible, and had better local organization of associations than the low openness to experience group. We also found that the high openness to experience group generated more responses on average and provided more unique responses than the low openness to experience group.

We provided evidence for the latter hypothesis using experiments that compared nonoverlapping groups of readers of two Indian languages (Telugu and Malayalam). Readers showed increased single-letter discrimination and decreased letter interactions for bigrams during visual search. Importantly, these interactions predicted subjects’ overall reading fluency. In a separate brain-imaging experiment, we observed increased compositionality in readers, whereby responses to bigrams were more predictable from single letters. This effect was specific to the anterior lateral occipital region, where activations best matched behavior.

However, it also can be stressful, and when parents lack the resources needed to handle stressors related to parenting, they may develop parental burnout. This condition is characterized by an overwhelming exhaustion related to one’s parental role, an emotional distancing from one’s children, and a sense of parental ineffectiveness. Researchers have begun to document the antecedents of parental burnout, but little is known about its consequences. Here we investigated the impact of parental burnout on escape ideation, parental neglect, and parental violence through two cross-lagged longitudinal studies (N = 918, N = 822) that involved the completion of online surveys three times over a year. Results indicated that parental burnout strongly increases escape ideation as well as neglectful and violent behaviors toward one’s children (aggregated Cohen’s d = 1.31, 1.25, and 1.25, respectively).

The incidental model suggests that people talk politics for mostly idiosyncratic reasons, as by-products of nonpolitical social processes. To adjudicate between these accounts, we draw on a unique, multisite, panel data set of whole networks, with information about many social relationships, attitudes, and demographics. This evidence permits a stronger foundation for inferences than more common egocentric methods. We find that incidental processes shape discussion networks much more powerfully than purposive ones.

Policymakers and the general public may assume that such statements reflect objective conclusions, but their actual fidelity in representing science remains largely untested. For example, in recent decades, policy statements related to media effects have been released with increasing regularity. However, they have often provoked criticisms that they do not adequately reflect the state of the science on media effects. The News Media, Public Education and Public Policy Committee (a standing committee of APA’s Division 46, the Media Psychology and Technology division) reviewed all publicly available policy statements on media effects produced by professional organizations and evaluated them using a standardized rubric. It was found that current policy statements tend to be more definitive than is warranted by the underlying science, and often ignore conflicting research results. These findings have broad implications for policy statements more generally, outside the field of media effects. In general, the committee suggests that professional organizations run the risk of misinforming the public when they release policy statements that do not acknowledge debates and inconsistencies in a field, or limitations of methodology. In formulating policy statements, advocacy organizations may wish to focus less on claiming consensus and more on acknowledging areas of agreement, areas of disagreement, and limitations.",2019-03-01,2020-01-14T07:04:32Z,2020-01-14T07:04:50Z,2020-01-14T07:04:32Z,12-25,NA,1,2,NA,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9QYD3VGJ\Elson et al. - 2019 - Do Policy Statements on Media Effects Faithfully R.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,aggression; open data; open materials; mass media; policy statements; screen time; sexual behavior; violence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001043

Determining whether this process is characterized by tonotopic maps in primary or secondary auditory areas, with bilateral or leftward activity, remains a long-standing challenge. Magnetoencephalographic studies failed to show hierarchical and asymmetric hints for speech processing. We employed high-density electroencephalography to map the Salento Italian vowel system onto cortical sources using the N1 auditory evoked component. We found evidence that the N1 is characterized by hierarchical and asymmetrical indexes in primary and secondary auditory areas structuring vowel representations. Importantly, the N1 was characterized by early and late phases. The early N1 peaked at 125–135 msec and was localized in the primary auditory cortex; the late N1 peaked at 145–155 msec and was localized in the left superior temporal gyrus. We showed that early in the primary auditory cortex, the cortical spatial arrangements—along the lateral-medial and anterior-posterior gradients—are broadly warped by phonemotopic patterns according to the distinctive feature principle. These phonemotopic patterns are carefully refined in the superior temporal gyrus along the inferior-superior and anterior-posterior gradients.

To address this question, we used a dual-task paradigm: Participants prepared an action (e.g., grasping), while concurrently performing an orientation-change-detection task.

In this article, we quantify this tendency using information-theoretic measures and report on a study in which we tested the counterintuitive prediction that children will produce words that have a low frequency given the context, because these will be most informative. Using corpora of child-directed speech, we identified adjectives that varied in how informative (i.e., unexpected) they were given the noun they modified. In an initial experiment (N = 31) and in a replication (N = 13), 3-year-olds heard an experimenter use these adjectives to describe pictures. The children’s task was then to describe the pictures to another person. As the information content of the experimenter’s adjective increased, so did children’s tendency to comment on the feature that adjective had encoded. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that children balance informativeness with a competing drive to ease production.",2017-07-01,2018-03-20T00:23:01Z,2018-03-20T00:23:19Z,2018-03-20T00:23:01Z,954-966,NA,7,28,NA,Psychol Sci,What’s Worth Talking About?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4AXCJCA9\Bannard et al. - 2017 - What’s Worth Talking About Information Theory Rev.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001048

Stress research suggests that excellence norms can pose high demands that evoke negative affect and have negative downstream consequences. The Social Identity Approach, however, proposes that the more students identify with the university, the more they integrate university norms into their self-concept; this means that norms become students' internal standards (rather than represent external pressure). As a result, only weakly, but not strongly, identified students should feel (externally) pressured by and respond to excellence norms with negative affect.

It explores its administrative organisation and divisions; the exploitation of its woodland, pasture, and arable resources; and the creation, growth, and decline of its villages, hamlets and farmsteads. It takes as its central theme two inter-related oppositions: continuity and change, moments and processes. In particular it examines the role these played in the development of varying settlement morphologies (the area under investigation contains both nucleated and dispersed settlement forms) and in the introduction and demise of the open field system. Composite image from article showing screenshots of GIS and archive components The article is based on the investigation of twenty-one medieval villages and hamlets and their surrounding landscapes, straddling the Northamptonshire-Buckinghamshire boundary and previously falling within the royal forest of Whittlewood. This work was undertaken between 2000 and 2005 as part of an AHRC (formerly ARHB)-funded research project. This enquiry, and the use it has made of the comparative method, has pinpointed moments of village and hamlet 'creation' and the alternative forms that these could take in their earliest phases. The subsequent development of these settlements has been charted, revealing the divergent paths they took towards the nucleated or dispersed plans they present when first mapped in the 17th, 18th or 19th centuries. This dynamic pattern of settlement has been set against a background of related changes to the authoritative landscape, which saw the fission and fusion of administrative units; to the economic landscape, which witnessed the development of the open field system and the re-organisation of woodland; and to social and cultural landscapes, affected inter alia by the growth and decline of population, and the imposition of Forest Law. The reconstruction of these medieval village territories has only been achieved by adopting an interdisciplinary approach. Methodologies have included test pitting in village cores, larger excavations and trial trenches both within and outside the village, geophysical and earthwork survey, extensive fieldwalking, exhaustive documentary research, retrospective analysis of a rich corpus of early maps, targeted palaeoenvironmental sampling, detailed place-name study, and the comprehensive survey of the standing buildings of the area. This has generated a substantial body of evidence, the broader conclusions from which are due to be published in 2006 in a monograph entitled Medieval Villages in an English Landscape: Beginnings and Ends (Macclesfield, Windgather Press). In embracing the unique opportunity offered by e-publishing and its integration with extensive digital archives, this article thus aims to achieve far more than simply duplicating its sister publication. It does not offer the in-depth explanations for change that are set out in the monograph, but rather focuses on the mechanics of change. But by presenting all the data on which reconstructions of these villages' territories have been based, readers will be able to test the veracity of the conclusions outlined both here and in the monograph, and to identify the intrinsic strengths and weaknesses of each class of evidence. It is hoped that by providing access to the data, readers will be encouraged to explore their own research agenda and to develop different readings of the evidence on which alternative models of medieval settlement and landscape change can be built.

The credibility makes it possible for the speaker to be viewed as open-minded, which subsequently inspires greater hope. This process culminates in an increased openness to the outgroup. These findings have been restricted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but here we examine their generalizability to racial conflict in the United States. Results reveal that White Americans exposed to internal criticism expressed by a Black authority figure express greater openness to African-American perspectives on race relations and are more willing to support policies of racial equality.

Results from four studies (total N = 754) document a tendency to more strongly support the inclusion of women in male-dominated careers, compared to the inclusion of men in female-dominated careers. This asymmetry in support for social action towards change is predicted by beliefs about what the ideal gender representation should be and the perceived causes of gender imbalances in each career type.

Despite advances in treatments that slow progression and minimize locomotor impairments, its clinical management is still a challenge. Previous preclinical studies, using mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation and isolated physical exercise (EX), reported beneficial results for treatment of PD. Therefore, this experimental randomized study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic potential of combined therapy using adipose-derived human MSCs (ADSCs) grafted into the striatum in conjunction with aerobic treadmill training, specifically in terms of locomotor performance in a unilateral PD rat model induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Forty-one male Wistar rats were categorized into five groups in accordance with the type of treatment to which they were subjected (Sham, 6-OHDA − injury, 6-OHDA + exercise, 6-OHDA + cells, and 6-OHDA + combined). Subsequently, dopaminergic depletion was assessed by the methylphenidate challenge and the specified therapeutic intervention was conducted in each group. The foot fault task was performed at the end of the experiment to serve as an assessment of motor skills. The results showed that despite disturbances in motor balance and coordination, locomotor dysfunction was ameliorated in all treatment categories in comparison to the injury group (sign test, p < 0.001, effect size: 0.71). The exercise alone and combined groups were the categories that exhibited the best recovery in terms of movement performance (p < 0.001). Overall, this study confirms that exercise is a powerful option to improve motor function and a promising adjuvant intervention for stem cell transplantation in the treatment of PD motor symptoms.

L1 performance of Turkish immigrants (n = 57) in the United Kingdom with age at onset ranging between 7 and 34 years was compared to that of Turkish monolingual controls (n = 29) across two linguistic properties: structural complexity and accent. Findings generally showed that although the immigrants achieved nativelike proficiency with respect to the overall structural complexity of their L1, this was not the case for accent as those with an earlier age of onset were less likely to sound like native Turkish speakers. We discuss these findings in relation to two competing theoretical models of age effects and suggest that attrition data need to be better accommodated within these models.

Using a sample of 404 healthy adults, we examined the roles of perceived social support and received hugs in buffering against interpersonal stress-induced susceptibility to infectious disease. Perceived support was assessed by questionnaire, and daily interpersonal conflict and receipt of hugs were assessed by telephone interviews on 14 consecutive evenings. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a virus that causes a common cold and were monitored in quarantine to assess infection and illness signs. Perceived support protected against the rise in infection risk associated with increasing frequency of conflict. A similar stress-buffering effect emerged for hugging, which explained 32% of the attenuating effect of support. Among infected participants, greater perceived support and more-frequent hugs each predicted less-severe illness signs.

There are two possible accounts for this pattern of results. Reduced performance with ‘conflict’ tools may simply reflect weakened automaticity of use action activation, which is evident only when the use and grasp actions are not redundant. Alternatively, poor use performance may reflect a reduced ability of appropriate tool use actions to compete with task-inappropriate action representations. To address this issue, we developed a Stroop-like experiment in which 21 LCVA and 8 neurotypical participants performed pantomime actions in blocks containing two tools that were similar (“neighbors”) in terms of hand action or function, or were unrelated on either dimension. In a congruent condition, they pantomimed the use action associated with the visually presented tool, whereas in an incongruent condition, they pantomimed the use action for the other tool in the block. Relative to controls and other task conditions, LCVA participants showed reductions in hand action errors in incongruent relative to congruent action trials; furthermore, the degree of reduction in this incongruence effect was related to the participants' susceptibility to grasp-on-use conflict in a separate test of pantomime to the sight of tools. Support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping analyses identified the left inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus as core neuroanatomical sites associated with abnormal performance. Collectively, the results indicate that weakened activation of tool use actions in limb apraxia gives rise to reduced ability of these actions to compete for task-appropriate selection when competition arises within single tools (grasp-on-use conflict) as well as between two tools (reduced neighborhood effects).",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:55:25Z,2020-01-30T11:13:22Z,2020-01-30T07:55:24Z,269-283,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TGPYZDJ4\Garcea et al. - 2019 - Reduced competition between tool action neighbors .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3FA5URHA\S0010945219302345.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Action selection; Left inferior frontal gyrus; Left supramarginal gyrus; Limb apraxia; Tool use,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001064

The present study examined autobiographical memories cued by self-images (e.g., I am a father) and non-self-related cues in 16 AD patients and 29 healthy older adults. The AD group generated fewer self-images and memories compared to controls, but demonstrated similar temporal organization of self-cued memories. In both groups, self-images were supported by semantic memories that were temporally clustered around times of identity-formation. These self-supporting memories are proposed to form a scaffold to support the self and may persist the longest in AD, as opposed to memories from early adulthood per se. In both AD and control groups, self-images cued more semantic memories than non-self-relevant cues, further suggesting that semantic autobiographical memories play a fundamental role in supporting the self. These findings demonstrate that the self remains largely intact in AD, in spite of severe episodic memory deficits and global cognitive decline.

In four studies (total N = 2086), we investigated preferences for consequentialist vs. non-consequentialist social partners endorsing instrumental harm or impartial beneficence and examined how such preferences varied across different types of social relationships. Our results demonstrate robust preferences for non-consequentialist over consequentialist agents in the domain of instrumental harm, and weaker – but still evident – preferences in the domain of impartial beneficence. In the domain of instrumental harm, non-consequentialist agents were consistently viewed as more moral and trustworthy, preferred for a range of social roles, and entrusted with more money in economic exchanges. In the domain of impartial beneficence, preferences for non-consequentialist agents were observed for close interpersonal relationships requiring direct interaction (friend, spouse) but not for more distant roles with little-to-no personal interaction (political leader).

In the current study, we investigated two opposing hypotheses: (a) that WM stores the interactions individually (the individual-storage hypothesis) and (b) that WM stores the interactions as chunks (the chunk-storage hypothesis). We required participants to memorize a set of individual actions while ignoring the underlying social interactions. We found that although the social-interaction aspect was task irrelevant, the interactive actions were stored in WM as chunks that were not affected by memory load (Experiments 1 and 2); however, inverting the human actions vertically abolished this chunking effect (Experiment 3).

Individual differences in perception should therefore be jointly determined by a person’s sensitivity to incoming evidence and his or her prior expectations. It has been proposed that individuals with autism have flatter prior distributions than do nonautistic individuals, which suggests that prior variance is linked to the degree of autistic traits in the general population. We tested this idea by studying how perceived speed changes during pursuit eye movement and at low contrast. We found that individual differences in these two motion phenomena were predicted by differences in thresholds and autistic traits when combined in a quantitative Bayesian model.

Following a manipulation of perceived risk of infection (low vs. high risk), they listened to a mock radio show in which some of the facts were selectively practiced.

To understand the mechanisms underlying this effect, we manipulated factors to do with the situation in which emotion was expressed, the type of person expressing emotion, and the way emotion was expressed. We also conducted replications of these experiments.

How subgroup stereotypes influence memory for superordinate groups,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,0022-1031,10.1016/j.jesp.2019.02.007,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311830372X,"Members of different groups often disagree when it comes to determining which group most accurately represents a shared superordinate group. Many studies have shown that the ingroup is often perceived as more prototypical of a superordinate category than the outgroup (i.e., relative prototypicality effect). This higher perceived congruence (overlap) between ingroup and superordinate group representations should be reflected in individuals' information processing and memory regarding the superordinate group. The authors hypothesized that in recall paradigms (H1), individuals would initially show better memory for information from the superordinate group that is inconsistent (rather than consistent) with the ingroup stereotype. We assumed that in recognition paradigms (H2), individuals would be more likely to attribute information to the superordinate group if the information was consistent with ingroup vs. outgroup stereotypes. Finally, we hypothesized that in recognition paradigms, individuals would confuse the ingroup with the superordinate group more often than they would confuse the outgroup with the superordinate group (H3). Five experiments testing these hypotheses (N = 314) and using different groups and stimulus modalities generally support these assumptions. The findings suggest that perceivers initially engage in inconsistency processing when confronted with information from a superordinate group that contradicts their ingroup-based expectation. However, even though perceivers initially recall such information particularly well, they are not able to integrate contradictory information successfully. More generally, our findings indicate that the perceived overlap between ingroup and superordinate group representations affects individuals' memory and thus helps explain why the relative prototypicality effect is such a robust phenomenon.",2019-07-01,2020-02-06T01:35:13Z,2020-02-10T11:49:59Z,2020-02-06T01:35:13Z,23-36,NA,NA,83,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,What did they say?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FH9A46PM\Berthold et al. - 2019 - What did they say How subgroup stereotypes influe.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XTWW29XA\S002210311830372X.html,NA,OSBadgePreregistered,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Memory; Ingroup projection; Social categorization; Superordinate groups,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001074

Opioids cause tonic activation of glutamate NMDA receptors (NMDARs) at primary afferent terminals, increasing nociceptive input. However, the signaling mechanisms responsible for opioid-induced activation of pre-synaptic NMDARs in the spinal dorsal horn remain unclear. In this study, we determined the role of MAPK signaling in opioid-induced pre-synaptic NMDAR activation caused by chronic morphine administration. Whole-cell recordings of excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) were performed on dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. Chronic morphine administration markedly increased the frequency of miniature EPSCs, increased the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs evoked from the dorsal root, and reduced the paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs. These changes were fully reversed by an NMDAR antagonist and normalized by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38, or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Furthermore, intrathecal injection of a selective ERK1/2, p38, or JNK inhibitor blocked pain hypersensitivity induced by chronic morphine treatment. These inhibitors also similarly attenuated a reduction in morphine's analgesic effect in rats. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that NMDARs formed a protein complex with ERK1/2, p38, and JNK in the spinal cord and that chronic morphine treatment increased physical interactions of NMDARs with these three MAPKs. Our findings suggest that opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance are mediated by tonic activation of pre-synaptic NMDARs via three functionally interrelated MAPKs at the spinal cord level.

Understanding this basic decision-making process is key if we are to gain insight on how to combat societal problems like obesity and other issues related to diet.

Participants encoded sensorimotor-rich memories by enacting a lab-based crime (stealing a ring) and received instructions to suppress memory of the crime in order to evade guilt detection in a brain-wave-based concealed-information test. Aftereffects of suppression on automatic memory processes were measured in an autobiographical Implicit Association Test. Results showed that suppression attenuated brain-wave activity (the P300) associated with crime-relevant memory retrieval, which rendered waveforms from innocent and guilty participants indistinguishable. However, the two groups could nevertheless be discriminated via the late-posterior-negative slow wave, which may reflect the need to monitor response conflict arising between voluntary suppression and automatic recognition processes. Finally, extending recent findings that suppression can impair implicit memory processes, we provide novel evidence that suppression reduces automatic cognitive biases often associated with actual autobiographical memories.",2015-07-01,2018-03-20T04:47:46Z,2018-03-20T04:47:55Z,2018-03-20T04:47:46Z,1098-1106,NA,7,26,NA,Psychol Sci,Suppressing Unwanted Autobiographical Memories Reduces Their Automatic Influences,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RPMA2H45\Hu et al. - 2015 - Suppressing Unwanted Autobiographical Memories Red.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001081

To overcome this problem, we developed and validated a unitary taxonomy of social power motives based on established delineations of social hierarchies: the dominance, prestige, and leadership account. While we could measure these motives both reliably and distinctively (study 1), we also showed they strongly related to a common power desire (study 2). Assessing their nomological networks (studies 3 and 4), we demonstrated distinct associations between the dominance motive (D: wanting to coerce others into adhering to one's will) and anger and verbal aggression; the prestige motive (P: wanting to obtain admiration and respect) and the fear of losing reputation and claiming to have higher moral concerns; the leadership motive (L: wanting to take responsibility in and for one's group) and emotional stability and helping behaviour. Furthermore, while D uniquely predicted agonistic/retaliatory behaviour in dictator games (study 5), L uniquely predicted the attainment of higher employment ranks in various professions (study 7). Finally, at least to some degree, P and L related positively, and D negatively to prosocial donating behaviour (study 6). This taxonomy represents a novel and powerful approach to predicting influential social behaviour. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019-01-01,2019-03-20T17:50:49Z,2019-03-20T17:51:41Z,2019-03-20T17:50:49Z,7-33,NA,1,33,NA,European Journal of Personality,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Z7D7RR2W\Suessenbach e.a. - 2019 - The Dominance, Prestige, and Leadership Account of.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AQCRDV6Q\per.html",NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,OSBadgePreregisteredPlus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dominance; leadership; power motive; prestige; social hierarchies,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a001087

Despite their crucial role, the study of the nature and organization of executive functions still faces inherent difficulties. Moreover, most executive function models put under test until now are brain-free models: they are defined and discussed without assumptions regarding the neural bases of executive functions. By using a latent variable approach, here we tested a brain-centered model of executive function organization proposing that two distinct domain-general executive functions, namely, criterion setting and monitoring, may be dissociable both functionally and anatomically, with a left versus right hemispheric preference of prefrontal cortex and related neural networks, respectively. To this end, we tested a sample of healthy participants on a battery of computerized tasks assessing criterion setting and monitoring processes and involving diverse task domains, including the verbal and visuospatial ones, which are well-known to be lateralized. By doing this, we were able to specifically assess the influence of these task domains on the organization of executive functions and to directly contrast a process-based model of EF organization versus both a purely domain-based model and a process-based, but domain-dependent one. The results of confirmatory factor analyses showed that a purely process-based model reliably provided a better fit to the observed data as compared to alternative models, supporting the specific theoretical model that fractionates a subset of executive functions into criterion setting and monitoring with hemispheric specializations emerging regardless of the task domain.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:36:24Z,2020-01-30T07:40:29Z,2020-01-30T07:36:24Z,441-456,NA,NA,119,NA,Cortex,Neuro-cognitive architecture of executive functions,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BSU4TNXT\Ambrosini et al. - 2019 - Neuro-cognitive architecture of executive function.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4TB22C7L\S0010945219302813.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Executive functions; Factor analysis; Hemispheric specialization; Latent variable analysis; Monitoring; Task-setting,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001091

What explains men's dominance over these positions? Which factors predict women's appointments? With comprehensive cross-national data from the post–Cold War era, we develop and test three sets of hypotheses concerning women's access to the defense ministry. We show that women remain excluded when the portfolio's remit reinforces traditional beliefs about the masculinity of the position, particularly in states that are engaged in fatal disputes, governed by military dictators, and large military spenders. By contrast, female defense ministers emerge when expectations about women's role in politics have changed—that is, in states with female chief executives and parliamentarians.

However, the extent of voluntary control over which features of an attended multi-feature object are encoded and maintained in WM is debated. Some evidence suggests that attending to an object leads to obligatory storage of all of its features, whereas other evidence suggests that access to WM can be restricted to only goal-relevant features. Another possibility is that all features are initially encoded, but irrelevant features are removed from WM over time. To address these various possibilities, we used pattern classification of EEG signals to track the temporal evolution of representations reflecting the encoding and storage of task-relevant and irrelevant features in WM. In different blocks, participants remembered the orientation, color or both orientation and color of a colored, oriented grating. The color and orientation of the grating was randomly drawn from two distinct feature bins on each trial. To examine trial-specific activity reflecting storage of the object's features, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to classify what bin the stimulus features came from. Importantly, for orientation, the classifier produced reliably above-chance classification across the delay when orientation was task-relevant but not when it was task-irrelevant. Interestingly, orientation could be accurately classified on trials for which both orientation and color were remembered. Moreover, a separate measure corresponding to the probability of a feature belonging to the correct bin was significantly higher when orientation was task-relevant compared to task-irrelevant during encoding. Above-chance classification for color was only present during the initial 500 msec across all conditions. Our results suggest that although information about all of an object's features is present in the initial stimulus-evoked neural response, information about the task-irrelevant features is attenuated during stimulus encoding and is largely absent throughout the delay.",2019-02-01,2019-03-29T09:18:48Z,2019-03-29T09:19:47Z,2019-03-29T09:18:48Z,196-209,NA,NA,111,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IQ4U3P3Q\Bocincova and Johnson - 2019 - The time course of encoding and maintenance of tas.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8469G9EP\S0010945218303460.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Feature binding; Support-vector machine classifier; Top-down control; Working memory,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001093

Physiologically, AS contributes to synaptic homeostasis by participating in vesicle maintenance, trafficking, and release. Its avidity for highly curved acidic membranes has been related to the distinct chemistry of the N-terminal amphipathic helix adopted upon binding to appropriated lipid interfaces. Pathologically, AS populate a myriad of toxic aggregates ranging from soluble oligomers to insoluble amyloid fibrils. Different gain-of-toxic function mechanisms are linked to prefibrillar oligomers which are considered as the most neurotoxic species. Here, we investigated if amyloid oligomerization could hamper AS function as a membrane curvature sensor. We used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to quantitatively evaluate the interaction of oligomeric species, produced using a popular method based on lyophilization and rehydration, to lipid vesicles of different curvatures and compositions. We found that AS oligomerization has a profound impact on protein-lipid interaction, altering binding affinity and/or curvature sensitivity depending on membrane composition. Our work provides novel insights into how the formation of prefibrillar intermediate species could contribute to neurodegeneration due to a loss-of-function mechanism.

In study 1, we used the twin sample from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health IV) data. The results indicated that about 70% of the association between the Big Five personality traits and perceived stress was due to genetic influences. In study 2, we used the twin sample from the Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS I and II) to examine the genetic and environmental influences underlying the longitudinal relations between the Big Five personality traits and perceived stress. The results suggested that continuity in perceived stress was primarily accounted for by genetic influences, and changes in perceived stress were mainly due to nonshared environmental influences. The continuity in the association between the five personality traits and perceived stress was largely accounted for by genetic factors, and nonshared environmental factors made greater contributions to changes in the association between personality traits and perceived stress. Among the Big Five personality traits, the genetic components in conscientiousness and neuroticism made substantial contributions to the genetic link between personality traits and perceived stress across both studies.

This article examines a moderator of assortative mating—how well couple members knew each other before dating—suggested by recent findings related to market-based (i.e., competition) theories. Specifically, competition is pervasive to the extent that people achieve consensus about who possesses desirable qualities (e.g., attractiveness) and who does not. Because consensus is stronger earlier in the acquaintance process, assortative mating based on attractiveness should be stronger among couples who formed a relationship after a short period rather than a long period of acquaintance. A study of 167 couples included measures of how long partners had known each other before dating and whether they had been friends before dating, as well as coders’ ratings of physical attractiveness. As predicted, couples revealed stronger evidence of assortative mating to the extent that they knew each other for a short time and were not friends before initiating a romantic relationship.",2015-07-01,2018-03-20T04:46:32Z,2018-03-20T04:46:41Z,2018-03-20T04:46:32Z,1046-1053,NA,7,26,NA,Psychol Sci,Leveling the Playing Field,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JZ8K47P9\Hunt et al. - 2015 - Leveling the Playing Field Longer Acquaintance Pr.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001099

Yoga and meditation are highly popular. Purportedly, they foster well-being by curtailing self-enhancement bias. However, this “ego-quieting” effect contradicts an apparent psychological universal, the self-centrality principle. According to this principle, practicing any skill renders that skill self-central, and self-centrality breeds self-enhancement bias. We examined those opposing predictions in the first tests of mind-body practices’ self-enhancement effects. In Experiment 1, we followed 93 yoga students over 15 weeks, assessing self-centrality and self-enhancement bias after yoga practice (yoga condition, n = 246) and without practice (control condition, n = 231). In Experiment 2, we followed 162 meditators over 4 weeks (meditation condition: n = 246; control condition: n = 245). Self-enhancement bias was higher in the yoga (Experiment 1) and meditation (Experiment 2) conditions, and those effects were mediated by greater self-centrality. Additionally, greater self-enhancement bias mediated mind-body practices’ well-being benefits.

Determining whether rewarding, aversive and salient stimuli regulate the activity of striatal spiny projections neurons (SPNs) of the TS is therefore of paramount importance to understand its functions, which remain largely elusive. Taking advantage of genetically encoded biosensors (A-kinase activity reporter 3) to record protein kinase A signals and by analyzing the distribution of dopamine D1R- and D2R-SPNs in the TS, we characterized three subterritories: a D2R/A2aR-lacking, a D1R/D2R-intermingled and a D1R/D2R-SPNs-enriched area (corresponding to the amygdalostriatal transition). In addition, we provide evidence that the distribution of D1R- and D2R-SPNs in the TS is evolutionarily conserved (mouse, rat, gerbil). The in vivo analysis of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in these TS subterritories in response to distinct appetitive, aversive and pharmacological stimuli revealed that SPNs of the TS are not recruited by stimuli triggering innate aversive responses, fasting, satiety, or palatable signals whereas a reduction in ERK phosphorylation occurred following learned avoidance. In contrast, D1R-SPNs of the intermingled and D2R/A2aR-lacking areas were strongly activated by both D1R agonists and psychostimulant drugs (d-amphetamine, cocaine, 3,4-methyl enedioxy methamphetamine, or methylphenidate), but not by hallucinogens. Finally, a similar pattern of ERK activation was observed by blocking selectively dopamine reuptake. Together, our results reveal that the caudal TS might participate in the processing of specific reward signals and discrete aversive stimuli. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14526.

This intervention is based on the premise that unintentional bias is like a habit that can be broken with sufficient motivation, awareness, and effort. We conducted replication of the original habit-breaking intervention experiment in a sample more than three times the size of the original (N=292). We also measured all outcomes every other day for 14days and measured potential mechanisms for the intervention's effects. Consistent with previous results, the habit-breaking intervention produced a change in concern that endured two weeks post-intervention. These effects were associated with increased sensitivity to the biases of others and an increased tendency to label biases as wrong. Contrasting with the original work, both control and intervention participants decreased in implicit bias, and the effects of the habit-breaking intervention on awareness declined in the second week of the study. In a subsample recruited two years later, intervention participants were more likely than control participants to object on a public online forum to an essay endorsing racial stereotyping. Our results suggest that the habit-breaking intervention produces enduring changes in peoples' knowledge of and beliefs about race-related issues, and we argue that these changes are even more important for promoting long-term behavioral change than are changes in implicit bias.",2017-09-01,2018-04-06T00:13:37Z,2018-04-06T00:13:47Z,2018-04-06T00:13:37Z,133-146,NA,NA,72,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Breaking the prejudice habit,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3C24JYM5\Forscher et al. - 2017 - Breaking the prejudice habit Mechanisms, timecour.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9W6AXZQ7\S0022103116306436.html",NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Replication; Social cognition; Implicit bias; Intervention,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001102

We argue that such intergroup biases may result from an interaction of basic cognitive processes and the structure of the information ecology. This cognitiveecological model assumes that groups such as minorities and out-groups are often novel to a perceiver. At the level of cognition, novel groups are primarily associated with their unique attributes, that is, attributes that differentiate them from other groups. In the information ecology, however, unique attributes are likely to be negative. Thus, novel groups, and by proxy minorities and out-groups, tend to be associated with negative attributes, leading to an evaluative disadvantage. We demonstrated this disadvantage in three experiments in which participants successively formed impressions about two fictional groups associated with the same number of positive and negative attributes. Participants preferred the first group over the novel group as long as the groups’ unique attributes were negative.",2018-07,2019-04-06T18:14:43Z,2019-04-06T18:14:51Z,2019-04-06T18:14:43Z,1126-1133,NA,7,29,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LYZV33NM\Alves e.a. - 2018 - A Cognitive-Ecological Explanation of Intergroup B.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001103

A coin flip reduces the need for information in decision-making,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,0022-1031,10.1016/j.jesp.2019.04.003,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103118303950,"When deciding between two options, settling can be difficult if one option is superior on one dimension but inferior on another. To arrive at a conclusion, people may gather further information, thereby running the risk of prolonging or blocking the decision-making process or even making suboptimal decisions. Here, we suggest that random decision aids may prove fruitful by reducing the need for further information. Five experiments (total N = 997) examined how information need is influenced after making a preliminary decision between two options and then receiving a suggestion from a random decision aid (a coin flip). Across studies, coin participants are less likely to request additional information (Study 1 and two follow-up studies, combined p = .021) and indicate a lower need for additional information (Study 2, p = .023, and Study 3, p = .001) compared to a control condition without a coin flip. Interestingly, participants do not necessarily adhere to the coin but stick to their preliminary decision as much as or even more than the control group, suggesting that the decision aid does not determine the decision outcome. This is true for hypothetical decisions between changing versus maintaining the status quo without an objectively correct solution (Studies 1, 1b, and 1c), for a decision between two options with an objectively correct solution (Study 2), and for a real monetary decision without an objectively correct solution (Study 3). Random decision aids may thus help to avoid decision blocks or the collection of too much information.",2019-07-01,2020-02-06T01:37:23Z,2020-02-10T11:49:03Z,2020-02-06T01:37:23Z,132-141,NA,NA,83,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Toss and turn or toss and stop?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\IKLLD4IV\Douneva et al. - 2019 - Toss and turn or toss and stop A coin flip reduce.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I47HIK9F\S0022103118303950.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Decision-making; Coin flip; Information need; Random device,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001104

Yet it remains unclear whether the use of these gestures can aid the learning of L2 intonation, especially by tonal-language speakers. Sixty-four Mandarin speakers with basic-level Spanish were asked to learn three Spanish intonation patterns, all involving a low tone on the nuclear accent. In a pre-post test experimental design, half of the participants received intonation training without the use of pitch gestures (the control group) while the other half received the same training but with pitch gestures representing nuclear intonation contours (the experimental group). Musical (melody, pitch) abilities were also measured. The results revealed that (a) the experimental group significantly improved intonational production outcomes, and (b) even though participants with stronger musical abilities performed better, those with weaker musical abilities benefited more from observing pitch gestures.",2019-03,2020-01-28T05:42:13Z,2020-01-28T05:42:52Z,2020-01-28T05:42:13Z,5-32,NA,1,41,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cambridge Core,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\M8UVCTDK\Yuan et al. - 2019 - OBSERVING PITCH GESTURES FAVORS THE LEARNING OF SP.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4LXVAME2\D04E84DB1C6786E8105917338A58F7C1.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001105

In this article, I show why this approach can yield misleading conclusions about citizen competence. I argue that although citizens with strong partisan loyalties might be forced to accept the same facts, they find alternative ways to rationalize reality. One such way, I show, is through the selective attribution of credit and blame. With four randomized experiments, conducted in diverse national settings and containing closed- as well as open-ended questions, I find that as partisans correctly updated economic beliefs to reflect new facts, they conversely attributed responsibility in a highly selective fashion.

Although generalisation in property induction and predictive learning tasks share conceptual similarities, it is unknown whether this diversity principle applies to generalisation of a predictive association. We tested this hypothesis in two predictive learning experiments using differential training where one category of stimuli (e.g., fruits) predicted an outcome and another category (e.g., vegetables) predicted no outcome. We compared generalisation between a Non-Diverse group who were presented with non-diverse evidence in both positive (predicted the outcome) and negative (predicted no outcome) categories, and two groups who received the same training as the Non-Diverse group but with a more diverse range of exemplars in the positive (Diverse+ group) or negative (Diverse– group) category. Diversity effects were found for both positive and negative categories, in that learning about a diverse range of exemplars increased generalisation of a predictive association to novel exemplars from that same category.

Within-subject processes are proposed to explain between-subject associations of dispositional motives and relationship satisfaction. For an empirical test of the model, data on the dispositional partner-related need for communion and global relationship satisfaction were obtained from 152 individuals in heterosexual relationships. In an extensive experience sampling spanning 2 weeks, a subsample of 130 individuals answered questions about their current motivational states, mood, state relationship satisfaction, and experiences with their partner five times a day. The results were largely consistent with the DynaMoS model: (1) individuals with a strong dispositional implicit communion motive reported more often to be in a communal motivational state; (2) communally motivated individuals were more likely to engage in subsequent instrumental behaviour; and (3) relationship experiences that potentially satisfy communion motivation led to more positive relationship outcomes when individuals were motivated before compared with when they were not. It is discussed how these results and the experience sampling method can foster our understanding of how dispositional characteristics translate into everyday processes and shape relationship outcomes.

In a single experiment (N = 8,925), we compared three fair-lineup techniques used by the police with unfair lineups in which we did nothing to prevent distinctive suspects from standing out.

We tested five key hypotheses regarding cultural change in individualism-collectivism.

The relationship with changes in individualism was less robust for urbanization.

Using the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating study (FLASHE), we analyze responses from 1717 parent-adolescent dyads from across the U.S., and explore a dyadic extension to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). We evaluate how parenting styles that characterize each parent-adolescent dyad moderate the degree to which parents' and adolescents' own attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are associated with the other person's behaviors across four domains: fruit and vegetable consumption, junk food and sugary drinks consumption, engagement in physical activity, and engagement in screen time sedentary behaviors. We find that the association between parents' attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control and their adolescent's eating behavior tends to be stronger when parents have an authoritative parenting style. However, we also find that the association between adolescents' attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control and their parent's eating behavior tends to be stronger when parents have an authoritative parenting style.

However, the mechanisms that regulate BACE1 expression are unclear. Here, we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) decreases BACE1 expression by up-regulating suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The activation of PPARδ by GW501516, a specific PPARδ agonist, inhibited expression of BACE1. This effect was abrogated by shRNA-mediated knockdown of PPARδ and by treatment with the PPARδ antagonist GSK0660, indicating that PPARδ is involved in GW501516-mediated suppression of BACE1 expression. On the other hand, GW501516-activated PPARδ induced expression of SOCS1, which is a negative regulator of cytokine signal transduction, at the transcriptional level by binding to a PPAR response element in its promoter. This GW501516-mediated induction of SOCS1 expression led to down-regulation of BACE1 expression via inactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. GW501516-activated PPARδ suppressed the generation of neurotoxic amyloid beta (Aβ) in accordance with the decrease in BACE1 expression. Taken together, these results indicate that PPARδ attenuates BACE1 expression via SOCS1-mediated inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 signaling, thereby suppressing BACE1-associated generation of neurotoxic Aβ.",2019,2020-02-06T02:44:31Z,2020-02-06T02:45:22Z,2020-02-06T02:44:31Z,370-385,NA,3,151,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 International Society for Neurochemistry,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7X358ZKT\Lee et al. - 2019 - Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated re.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DJE7C6SG\jnc.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Alzheimer's disease; BACE1; amyloid beta; PPARδ; SOCS1; STAT1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001117

Using the Ponzo illusion to manipulate perceived size while keeping retinal size constant, we demonstrated across 71 participants that visual objects attract attention when their perceived size matches a memory template, compared with mismatching objects that have the same size on the retina.

Rules for these elections—such as concurrence, term limits, and second-round voting—suggest that we should reconceptualize the notion of the clarity of responsibility in Latin America, focusing more on individuals in power and their constraints, and less on the political parties from which they hail.",2018,2019-03-19T12:54:24Z,2019-03-19T12:54:37Z,2019-03-19T12:54:24Z,410-423,NA,2,62,NA,NA,Economic Voting in Latin America,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"©2018, Midwest Political Science Association",NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\54HHY4ER\Valdini en Lewis‐Beck - 2018 - Economic Voting in Latin America Rules and Respon.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QSR33FYC\ajps.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001122

However, the specific predictors and mechanisms of this form of female intrasexual competition are less well understood. We propose that one mechanism by which women harm rivals' social opportunities is through selectively transmitting reputation-relevant social information. Moreover, we contend that this behavior is designed to undermine the romantic and social appeal of same-sex romantic rivals who are perceived to be threatening. Evidence from five studies suggests that women's dissemination of social information is strategic and reliably predicted by various cues of romantic rival threat: attempts at mate poaching (Study 1), physical attractiveness (Studies 2 and 3), and provocative clothing (Studies 4 and 5). Women strategically harmed and failed to enhance the reputations of other women who threatened their romantic prospects directly (by flirting with their romantic partners) and indirectly (by being attractive or provocatively dressed). Women's dispositional levels of competitiveness also predicted their information transmission: highly competitive women (both generally and in romantic domains specifically) disclosed more reputation-damaging information than did less competitive women. Furthermore, women transmitted reputation-harming information about female targets independent of how much they explicitly liked those targets, suggesting a disconnect between women's intentions and their gossip behavior. Irrespective of the gossiper's intentions, pilot data confirmed that social harm is likely to befall the women targeted by the transmission of reputation-damaging social information.",2018-09-01,2019-03-30T16:43:21Z,2019-03-30T16:43:35Z,2019-03-30T16:43:21Z,195-209,NA,NA,78,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Competitive reputation manipulation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3IZGA68V\Reynolds e.a. - 2018 - Competitive reputation manipulation Women strateg.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KI9GG4T5\S0022103117304195.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Competitiveness; Gossip; Indirect aggression; Intrasexual competition; Reputation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001125

By analyzing the localization of neuronal membrane proteins in X11-, X11L-, and X11/X11L doubly deficient mice with membrane fractionation procedures, we found that deficient of X11 and X11L decreased the level of glutamate receptors in non-PSD fraction. This finding suggests that X11 and X11L regulate the glutamate receptor micro-localization to the extrasynaptic region. In vitro coimmunoprecipitation studies of NMDA receptors lacking various cytoplasmic regions with X11 and X11L proteins harboring domain deletion suggest that extrasynaptic localization of NMDA receptor may be as a result of the multiple interactions of the receptor subunits with X11 and X11L regulated by protein phosphorylation, while that of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunits is not dependent on the binding with X11 and X11L proteins. Because the loss of X11 and X11L tends to impair the exocytosis, but not endocytosis, of glutamate receptors, NMDA receptors are likely to be supplied to the extrasynaptic plasma membrane with a way distinct from the mechanism regulating the localization of NMDA receptors into synaptic membrane region. Reduced localization of NMDA receptor into the extrasynaptic region increased slightly the phosphorylation level of cAMP responsible element binding protein in brain of X11/X11L doubly deficient mice compare to wild-type mice, suggesting a possible role of X11 and X11L in the regulation of signal transduction pathway through extrasynaptic glutamate receptors.

In the present study we sought to investigate the relationship between trait anxiety, prefrontal glutamate levels and functional activation in DLPFC during a cognitive control task. Thirty-nine participants assigned to either low trait anxiety (LTA) or high trait anxiety (HTA) groups underwent 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to measure levels of resting glutamate in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Participants also completed fMRI during a Stroop task comprising congruent and incongruent colour word trials. The HTA group showed reduced task performance relative to the LTA group.

Do these benefits disqualify prosocial acts from being truly altruistic? Scientists and philosophers have long debated this question, but few have considered laypeople's beliefs about altruism. Here, we examine such lay theories surrounding altruism. Across two studies, observers read about agents who behaved prosocially. In some cases, agents benefitted materially, socially, or emotionally from their actions (self-oriented consequences); in other cases, they acted in order to accrue these benefits (self-oriented motives). Observers “penalized” actions that produced self-oriented consequences – rating them as less altruistic than actions involving no such benefit – unless these benefits were emotional. When agents' actions involved self-oriented motives, observers penalized them more harshly, viewing their behavior as more selfish than even clearly non-prosocial acts.

Most importantly, we focused on compensatory balance reactions where the arms were required to regain stability following unexpected postural perturbation. Our first question was if motor cortical activity from the hand area automatically corresponds to the visual environment. Affordance-based priming of the motor system was assessed using single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to determine if visual access to a wall-mounted support handle influenced corticospinal excitability. We evaluated if hand actions were automatically facilitated and/or suppressed by viewing an available handle within graspable range. Our second question was if the requirement for rapid movement to recover balance played a role in modulating any affordance effect in the hands. The goal was to disentangle motor demands related to postural threat from the impact of observation alone. For balance trials, a custom-built, lean and release apparatus was used to impose temporally unpredictable postural perturbations. In all balance trials, perturbations were of sufficient magnitude to evoke a compensatory change-in-support response; therefore, any recovery action needed to carefully take into account the affordances and constraints of the perceived environment to prevent a fall. Consistent with our first hypothesis, activity in an intrinsic hand muscle was increased when participants passively viewed a wall-mounted safety handle, in both seated and standing contexts. Contrary to our second hypothesis, this visual priming was absent when perturbations were imposed and the handle was needed to regain balance. Our results reveal that motor set is influenced by simply viewing objects that afford a grasp. We suggest that such preparation may provide an advantage when generating balance recovery actions that require quickly grasping a supportive handle. This priming effect likely competes with other task-dependent influences that regulate cortical motor output. Future studies should expand from limitations inherent with single-pulse TMS alone, to determine if vision of our surrounding world influences motor set in other contexts (e.g., intensified postural threat) and investigate if this priming corresponds to overt behavior.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:20:15Z,2020-01-30T07:20:36Z,2020-01-30T07:20:15Z,135-146,NA,NA,117,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TTD2AL7W\Bolton et al. - 2019 - Motor preparation for compensatory reach-to-grasp .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZBXH42YU\S0010945219301030.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Affordance; Anticipatory set; Corticospinal excitability; Reactive balance,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001132

Selecting a suitable sleeping site is therefore essential for an individual’s fitness. Here we test the importance of antipredator and thermoregulatory hypotheses for the sleeping site preference of a nocturnal primate, the Northern lesser galago (Galago senegalensis), in Northern Tanzania. During June to August of 2015 and 2016 we conducted daily surveys of sleeping sites to record the number of galagos and their location within the sleeping tree, and used focal follows to record when galagos reached and left sleeping sites. We collected vegetation data for sleeping sites (N = 47) and matched controls, and placed data loggers in sleeping (N = 14) and control locations to compare temperature and humidity. Sleeping group sizes were similar to that of G. senegalensis in The Gambia, and the mean proportion of visits in which galagos were present at each site was 27 ± SD 25%. Galagos slept on branches (N = 29), nests (N = 6), palm leaves (N = 6), and in tree cavities (N = 1). Palm leaves have not been previously recorded as regular sleeping sites for galagos and were overrepresented relative to their occurrence in the habitat. Random forest classification analysis revealed that galagos sleep in areas with greater canopy cover and connectivity, greater mid-level vegetation cover, higher tree density, and a greater number of Acacia trees. Sleeping locations had significantly lower mean temperatures but greater mean humidity than control locations. Our findings support predator avoidance and thermoregulation as drivers of nesting behavior. In particular, the characteristics of galago sleeping sites correspond well to those expected for protection from aerial predators, while those related to protection from terrestrial predators seem to play a minor role.",2019-04-01,2020-02-03T05:25:20Z,2020-02-03T05:25:41Z,2020-02-03T05:25:20Z,276-296,NA,2,40,NA,Int J Primatol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Springer Link,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HU6AL4L4\Ellison et al. - 2019 - Sleeping Site Selection in the Nocturnal Northern .pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ecology; Galago; Microclimate; Predation; Primate behavior; Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001133

While such distraction is typically regarded as potentially important in everyday life, previous work has so far not examined how deviant sounds affect performance on more complex daily tasks. In this study, we developed a new method to examine whether deviant sounds can disrupt reading performance by recording participants’ eye movements. Participants read single sentences in silence and while listening to task-irrelevant sounds. In the latter condition, a 50-ms sound was played contingent on the fixation of five target words in the sentence. On most occasions, the same tone was presented (standard sound), whereas on rare and unexpected occasions it was replaced by white noise (deviant sound). The deviant sound resulted in significantly longer fixation durations on the target words relative to the standard sound. A time-course analysis showed that the deviant sound began to affect fixation durations around 180 ms after fixation onset. Furthermore, deviance distraction was not modulated by the lexical frequency of target words. In summary, fixation durations on the target words were longer immediately after the presentation of the deviant sound, but there was no evidence that it interfered with the lexical processing of these words. The present results are in line with the recent proposition that deviant sounds yield a temporary motor suppression and suggest that deviant sounds likely inhibit the programming of the next saccade.",2019-07-01,2020-02-05T06:10:41Z,2020-02-05T06:10:58Z,2020-02-05T06:10:41Z,1863-1875,NA,7,72,NA,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,Distraction by deviant sounds during reading,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NW3XHCJK\Vasilev et al. - 2019 - Distraction by deviant sounds during reading An e.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,reading; auditory distractors; Deviance distraction; eye-movements,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001134

Social psychology typically follows a tradition in which many participants perform a small number of trials each; in psychophysics, the tradition is to include only a few participants, who perform many trials each; and the tradition in cognitive psychology falls in between, balancing the number of participants and trials. We ask whether it is better to add trials or to add participants if one wishes to increase power. The answer is straightforward—greatest power is achieved by using more people, and the gain from adding people is greater than the gain from adding trials. In light of these results, the design parameters in the social psychology tradition seem ideal. Yet there are conditions in which one may trade people for trials with only a minor decrement in power. Under these conditions, the limiting factor is the trial-to-trial variability rather than the variability across people in the population. These conditions are highly plausible, and we present a theoretical argument as to why. We think that most cognitive effects are characterized by stochastic dominance; that is, everyone’s true effect is in the same direction. For example, it is plausible that when performing the Stroop task, all people truly identify congruent colors faster than incongruent ones. When dominance holds, small mean effects imply a small degree of variability across the population. It is this degree of homogeneity, the consequence of dominance, that licenses the design parameters of the cognitive psychology and psychophysics traditions.",2018-03-01,2020-01-14T06:46:57Z,2020-01-14T06:47:12Z,2020-01-14T06:46:57Z,19-26,NA,1,1,NA,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,"Power, Dominance, and Constraint",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FUYIR9BE\Rouder and Haaf - 2018 - Power, Dominance, and Constraint A Note on the Ap.pdf",NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,power; open materials; within-participants designs,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001136

Feeding hypercaloric, high-fat (HF) diet induces hypothalamic arcuate nucleus injury and alters metabolism more severely in male than in female mice. The site(s) and extent of hypothalamic injury in male and female mice are not completely understood. In the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, single-minded family basic helix-loop helix transcription factor 1 (Sim1) neurons are essential to control energy homeostasis. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to HF diet induces injury to Sim1 neurons in the PVN of male and female mice. Mice expressing membrane-bound enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP) in Sim1 neurons (Sim1-Cre:Rosa-mEGFP mice) were generated to visualize the effects of exposure to HF diet on these neurons. Male and female Sim1-Cre:Rosa-mEGFP mice exposed to HF diet had increased weight, hyperleptinemia, and developed hepatosteatosis. In male and female mice exposed to HF diet, expression of mEGFP was reduced by > 40% in Sim1 neurons of the PVN, an effect paralleled by cell apoptosis and neuronal loss, but not by microgliosis. In the arcuate nucleus of the Sim1-Cre:Rosa-mEGFP male mice, there was decreased alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in proopiomelanocortin neurons projecting to the PVN, with increased cell apoptosis, neuronal loss, and microgliosis. These defects were undetectable in the arcuate nucleus of female mice exposed to the HF diet. Thus, injury to Sim1 neurons of the PVN is a shared feature of exposure to HF diet in mice of both sexes, while injury to proopiomelanocortin neurons in arcuate nucleus is specific to male mice.

First, we tested a new approach to affect regulation dynamics, conceptualized as a network made up of the reciprocal influences that affect and affect regulation strategies constantly exert on each other. Second, we attempted to gain a better understanding of these dynamics by examining how they vary according to broad personality traits. To this end, we adopted an experience sampling method, involving five daily assessments over a 2?week period. In each assessment, participants indicated their current affective experience and the way they had implemented five well?known affect regulation strategies (i.e. appreciation, positive reappraisal, distraction, expressive suppression, and rumination) since the previous assessment. At the sample level, the network of affect regulation dynamics was characterized by positive feedback loops between positive affect and so?called broad?minded strategies, and between negative affect and narrow?minded strategies. The form of this network varied according to levels of extraversion and neuroticism. Our findings are discussed in light of current knowledge about personality and affect regulation.

The novelty of the studies reported here is that participants repeated the same task 6 to 8 weeks later. We found that between tasks, preferences returned to near their original levels, only to shift again to support the second choice, regardless of which choice participants made. Similar patterns were observed in a free-choice task (Study 1) and when the favorableness of options was manipulated (Study 2). It follows that preferences behave in an elastic manner: In the absence of situational pressures, they rest at baseline levels, but during the process of reaching a decision, they morph to support the chosen options.

Alcohol and Meth independently and differentially affect glutamatergic transmission but the unique effects of their serial exposure on glutamate signaling in mediating damage to dopamine neurons are unknown. Sprague–Dawley rats had intermittent voluntary access to 10% ethanol (EtOH) every other day and water over 28 days and were then administered a binge injection regimen of Meth or saline. EtOH drinking decreased the glutamate aspartate transporter and increased basal extracellular concentrations of glutamate within the striatum when measured after the last day of drinking. Ceftriaxone is known to increase the expression and/or activity of glutamate transporters in the brain and prevented both the decreases in glutamate aspartate transporter and the increases in basal extracellular glutamate when administered during EtOH drinking. EtOH drinking also exacerbated the acute increases in extracellular glutamate observed upon Meth exposure, the subsequent increases in spectrin proteolysis, and the long-term decreases in dopamine content in the striatum, all of which were attenuated by ceftriaxone administration during EtOH drinking only. These results implicate EtOH-induced increases in extracellular glutamate and corresponding decreases in glutamate uptake as mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability produced by EtOH drinking and the unique neurotoxicity observed after serial exposure to Meth that is not observed with either drug alone.

Yet the psychological categories that are involved and the selection pressures that underlie these categories remain unclear. A common view is that human pathogen-avoidance psychology is specifically adapted to avoid out-groups because of their potentially different pathogens. However, the series of studies reported here shows that there is no dedicated category for reasoning about out-groups in terms of pathogens. Specifically, a memory-confusion experiment conducted with two large-scale samples of Americans (one nationally representative) yielded strong, replicable evidence that healthy out-group members are represented using the same psychological category that is used to represent manifestly infected in-group members. This suggests that the link between out-group prejudice and pathogen concerns is a by-product of general mechanisms for treating any unfamiliar appearance as an infection cue.",2017-12-01,2018-03-19T23:52:28Z,2018-03-19T23:52:44Z,2018-03-19T23:52:28Z,1857-1863,NA,12,28,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DD49F6WC\Petersen - 2017 - Healthy Out-Group Members Are Represented Psycholo.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001147

Can protests also continue to shape a nation's contemporary politics outside of more formalized channels? I argue that social movements can not only beget institutional change, but also long-run, attitudinal change. Using the case of the U.S. civil rights movement, I develop a theory in which protests can shift attitudes and these attitudes can persist. Data from over 150,000 survey respondents provide evidence consistent with the theory. Whites from counties that experienced historical civil rights protests are more likely to identify as Democrats and support affirmative action, and less likely to harbor racial resentment against blacks. These individual-level results are politically meaningful?counties that experienced civil rights protests are associated with greater Democratic Party vote shares even today.

Noting the role of the gut microbiome in host physiology like nutrition and health, it is thus essential to understand how human–wildlife interactions and availability of anthropogenic food in habitats can affect an animal's gut microbiome. This study, therefore, set out to examine the gut microbiota of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) with varying accessibility to anthropogenic food and the possibility of using gut microbiota as indicator for macaques’ reliance on anthropogenic food. Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we described the microbial composition of Japanese macaques experiencing different types of human disturbance and anthropogenic food availability—captive, provisioned, crop-raiding, and wild. In terms of alpha diversity, our results showed that observed richness of gut microbiota did not differ significantly between disturbance types but among collection sites, whereas Shannon diversity index differed by both disturbance types and sites. In terms of beta diversity, captive populations harbored the most distinctive gut microbial composition, and had the greatest difference compared with wild populations. Whereas for provisioned and crop-raiding groups, the macaques exhibited intermediate microbiota between wild and captive. We identified several potential bacterial taxa at different taxonomic ranks whose abundance potentially could help in assessing macaques’ accessibility to anthropogenic food. This study revealed the flexibility of the gut microbiome of Japanese macaques and provided possible indices based on the gut microbiome profile in assessing macaques’ accessibility to/reliance on anthropogenic foods.",2019,2020-01-29T03:45:22Z,2020-01-29T03:45:47Z,2020-01-29T03:45:22Z,e23072,NA,12,81,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AK5V3NUF\Lee et al. - 2019 - Gut microbiota composition of Japanese macaques as.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QR4XHU66\ajp.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,human disturbance; primate; gut microbiome; Macaca,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001149

Here we investigate whether a positive bias that operates at the individual-level, belief in a good true self, may be leveraged to reduce intergroup bias. We find that even stereotypically threatening out-group agents are believed to have a good true self (Experiment 1). More importantly, consideration of an in-group and out-group members' true self reduces intergroup bias, both in the form of explicit evaluative judgments (Experiment 2) and actual donation behavior (Experiment 3). Across studies, the palliative effects of thinking of an individual's true self generalize to that individual's entire group. In sum, a simple intervention — thinking about another's true self — reduces the gap in how people evaluate and treat out-group relative to in-group members.

This assumption is that multimodal integration requires consciousness; however, few studies have explicitly tested if integration can occur between nonconscious information from different modalities. The proposed study examined whether a classic indicator of multimodal integration – the McGurk effect – can be elicited with subliminal auditory–visual speech stimuli. We used a masked speech priming paradigm developed by Kouider and Dupoux (2005) in conjunction with continuous flash suppression (CFS; Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005), a binocular rivalry technique for presenting video stimuli subliminally. Applying these techniques together, we carried out two experiments in which participants categorised auditory syllable targets which were preceded by subliminal auditory–visual (AV) speech primes. Subliminal AV primes were either illusion-inducing (McGurk) or illusion-neutral (Incongruent) combinations of speech stimuli. In Experiment 1, the categorisation of the syllable target (“pa”) was facilitated by the same syllable prime when it was part of a McGurk combination (auditory “pa” and visual “ka”) but not when part of an Incongruent combination (auditory “pa” and visual “wa”). This dependency on specific AV combinations indicated a nonconscious AV interaction. Experiment 2 presented a different syllable target (“ta”) which matched the predicted illusory outcome of the McGurk combination – here, both the McGurk combination (auditory “pa” and visual “ka”) and the Incongruent combination (auditory “ta” and visual “ka”) failed to facilitate target categorisation. The combined results of both Experiments demonstrate a type of nonconscious multimodal interaction that is distinct from integration – it allows unimodal information that is compatible for integration (i.e., McGurk combinations) to persist and influence later processes, but does not actually combine and alter that information. As the GWS model does not account for non-integrative multimodal interactions, this places some pressure on such models of consciousness.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:19:43Z,2020-01-30T07:20:07Z,2020-01-30T07:19:42Z,1-15,NA,NA,117,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FJW3IGYY\Ching et al. - 2019 - Auditory–visual integration during nonconscious pe.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WZVAT52H\S0010945219300668.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Priming; Consciousness; Multimodal integration; Subliminal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001152

Whether the descending modulation of nociceptive transmission from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) plays a role in CPSP induced by skin/muscle incision and retraction (SMIR) in the thigh is still unknown. In this study, we found that SMIR surgery, which induced either bilateral or unilateral mechanical allodynia, activated microglia, and up-regulated interleukin-1β (IL-1β), an important cytokine, and 8-hydroxyguanine, an oxidative stress marker in the RVM. In addition, the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was increased in the ipsilateral and contralateral RVM in rats with either bilateral or unilateral pain following SMIR. The 5-HT level increase, 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R) up-regulation, and microglia activation were found bilaterally in SMIR rats with bilateral pain, but only ipsilaterally in SMIR rats with unilateral pain. The intrathecal injection of the 5-HT3R antagonist Y25130 prevented the development of CPSP and the activation of spinal microglia induced by SMIR. Furthermore, P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) was up-regulated in microglia in the RVM. The microinjection of the P2X7R antagonist brilliant blue G (BBG, a non-competitive P2X7R antagonist) into the RVM prevented the development of mechanical allodynia, inhibited the activation of microglia, and decreased the expression of IL-1β and 8-hydroxyguanine in the RVM following SMIR. Importantly, BBG injected into the RVM also decreased the activation of microglia and the level of 5-HT in the lumbar 3 (L3) spinal cord. The microinjection of the P2X7R agonist BzATP, the NADPH oxidase activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, or IL-1β into the RVM induced bilateral mechanical allodynia, microglia activation, and 5-HT release in the L3 spinal dorsal horn. Taken together, P2X7R activation in microglia in the RVM following SMIR might be responsible for the development of CPSP via activating descending serotonergic pathway.

This article reports a preregistered large-scale attempt to replicate four influential anticipatory-looking implicit theory-of-mind tasks using original stimuli and procedures.

A second set of studies revealed, further, that this one paradigm was no longer replicated once confounds were removed, which calls its validity into question.

Adolescents underwent fMRI while viewing photos ostensibly submitted to Instagram. They were more likely to like photos depicted with many likes than photos with few likes; this finding showed the influence of virtual peer endorsement and held for both neutral photos and photos of risky behaviors (e.g., drinking, smoking). Viewing photos with many (compared with few) likes was associated with greater activity in neural regions implicated in reward processing, social cognition, imitation, and attention. Furthermore, when adolescents viewed risky photos (as opposed to neutral photos), activation in the cognitive-control network decreased.

We then tested the infants’ selective attention to two novel individuals after one sang the familiar song and the other sang the unfamiliar song. Infants who had experienced a parent singing looked longer at the new person who had sung the familiar melody than at the new person who had sung the unfamiliar melody, and the amount of song exposure at home predicted the size of that preference. Neither effect was observed, however, among infants who had heard the song emanating from a toy or being sung by a socially unrelated person, despite these infants’ remarkable memory for the familiar melody, tested an average of more than 8 months later.

In the present study, we aimed to replicate these findings in an eye-tracking experiment with better controlled materials and increased statistical power. Crucially, we found clear evidence for active gap-filling across all levels of dependency length.

Translational value of preclinical studies may be improved by appraisal of the quality of experimental design and risk of biases, which remains to be addressed for FST. The present protocol of a systematic review with meta-analysis aims to investigate the quality of preclinical studies employing FST to identify risks of bias in future publications. In addition, this protocol will help to determine the effect sizes (ES) for primary and secondary outcomes according to several aspects of the FST study design. Search strategy, Screening annotation, Data management Publications reporting studies testing different classes of antidepressants in FST will be collected from Medline, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. A broad list of inclusion criteria will be applied excluding those studies whereby FST is used as a stressor or studies reporting data from co-treatments. For assessing the quality of the included publications, the quality checklist adapted by Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies will be used. If the meta-analysis seems feasible, the ES and the 95% CI will be analysed. The heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by using the χ2statistic with n−1 degrees of freedom. Subgroup meta-analysis (meta-regression, and if necessary, stratified regression) will be performed when possible according to characteristics of study design and study quality to assess their impact on efficacy of the treatments. In addition, funnel plotting, Egger regression, and ‘trim and fill’ will be used to assess the risk of publication bias. Results of this protocol will help to create rational methodological guidelines for application of FST in rodents and improve the quality and translational value of preclinical research on antidepressant discovery. Reporting A preliminary version of the present protocol has been preregistered with Systematic Review Facility (http://syrf.org.uk/). A preprint version of the current protocol has been registered with Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/9kxm4/). Results will be communicated in scientific meetings and peer-reviewed journals. We plan to conduct an anonymous and online survey within the scientific community to ask researchers about their perception of risk of bias and their experience with the publication of negative results.",2019-05-01,2020-01-28T06:48:51Z,2020-01-28T06:49:09Z,2020-01-28T06:48:51Z,NA,NA,1,3,NA,NA,Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from preclinical studies employing forced swimming test,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Subjects first learned about an altruistic dictator, who subsequently made altruistic splits collectively with a partner. Results revealed that because the presence of the dictator already predicted the outcome, subjects did not learn to associate value with the partner. This social blocking effect was not observed in the loss domain: A kind robber’s partner, who could steal all the subjects’ money but stole little, acquired highly positive value—which biased subjects’ subsequent behavior.

However, the mechanisms of Mn toxicity are still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Mn dose- and time-dependently blocks the protein translation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and heavy-chain Ferritin (H-Ferritin), both iron homeostatic proteins with neuroprotective features. APP and H-Ferritin are post-transcriptionally regulated by iron responsive proteins, which bind to homologous iron responsive elements (IREs) located in the 5?-untranslated regions (5?-UTRs) within their mRNA transcripts. Using reporter assays, we demonstrate that Mn exposure repressed the 5?-UTR-activity of APP and H-Ferritin, presumably via increased iron responsive proteins-iron responsive elements binding, ultimately blocking their protein translation. Using two specific Fe2+-specific probes (RhoNox-1 and IP-1) and ion chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IC-ICP-MS), we show that loss of the protective axis of APP and H-Ferritin resulted in unchecked accumulation of redox-active ferrous iron (Fe2+) fueling neurotoxic oxidative stress. Enforced APP expression partially attenuated Mn-induced generation of cellular and lipid reactive oxygen species and neurotoxicity. Lastly, we could validate the Mn-mediated suppression of APP and H-Ferritin in two rodent in vivo models (C57BL6/N mice and RjHan:SD rats) mimicking acute and chronic Mn exposure. Together, these results suggest that Mn-induced neurotoxicity is partly attributable to the translational inhibition of APP and H-Ferritin resulting in impaired iron metabolism and exacerbated neurotoxic oxidative stress.

1165,QBZ8HBX2,journalArticle,2019,"Salek, Asma B.; Edler, Michael C.; McBride, Jonathon P.; Baucum, Anthony J.",Spinophilin regulates phosphorylation and interactions of the GluN2B subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor,Journal of Neurochemistry,NA,1471-4159,10.1111/jnc.14831,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jnc.14831,"N-methyl-d-Aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are abundant postsynaptic proteins that are critical for normal synaptic communication. NMDAR channel function is regulated by multiple properties, including phosphorylation. Inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in hippocampal neurons increases NMDAR activity, an effect abrogated by loss of spinophilin, the major PP1-targeting protein in the postsynaptic density. However, how spinophilin regulates PP1-dependent NMDAR function is unclear. We hypothesize that spinophilin regulates PP1 binding to the NMDAR to alter NMDAR phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that spinophilin interacts with the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR. In human embryonic kidney 293 FT cells, activation and/or overexpression of protein kinase A increased the association between spinophilin and the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR. Functionally, we found that spinophilin overexpression decreased PP1 binding to the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR and attenuated the PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of GluN2B at Ser-1284. Moreover, in P28 hippocampal lysates isolated from spinophilin KO compared to WT mice, there was increased binding of GluN2B to PP1, decreased phosphorylation of GluN2B at Ser-1284, and altered GluN2B protein interactions with postsynaptic density-enriched proteins. Together, our data demonstrate that spinophilin decreases PP1 binding to GluN2B and concomitantly enhances the phosphorylation of GluN2B at Ser-1284. The putative consequences of these spinophilin-dependent alterations in GluN2B phosphorylation and interactions on synaptic GluN2B localization and function are discussed.

Previously, we found that genetic ablation of Fzr1 promotes the death of neural progenitor cells leading to neurogenesis impairment and microcephaly in mouse. To ascertain the possible translation of these findings in humans, we searched for mutations in the Fzr1 gene in 390 whole exomes sequenced in trio in individuals showing neurodevelopmental disorders compatible with a genetic origin. We found a novel missense (p.Asp187Gly) Fzr1 gene mutation (c.560A>G) in a heterozygous state in a 4-year-old boy, born from non-consanguineous Spanish parents, who presents with severe antenatal microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and refractory epilepsy. Cdh1 protein levels in leucocytes isolated from the patient were significantly lower than those found in his parents. Expression of the Asp187Gly mutant form of Cdh1 in human embryonic kidney 293T cells produced less Cdh1 protein and APC/C activity, resulting in altered cell cycle distribution when compared with cells expressing wild-type Cdh1. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the Asp187Gly mutant form of Cdh1 in cortical progenitor cells in primary culture failed to abolish the enlargement of the replicative phase caused by knockout of endogenous Cdh1. These results indicate that the loss of function of APC/C-Cdh1 caused by Cdh1 Asp187Gly mutation is a new cause of prenatal microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and severe epilepsy.

Thus, there may be cultural differences in the representation of a concept. To assess this possibility, we compared the subjective semantic structure of “privacy” in Iran and the United States. Participants were 200 adults, 100 from Iran and 100 from the United States. In the first phase of the experiment, using the associative terms task, we detected nine of the most frequent terms that were associated with the concept of “privacy” in each culture. In the second phase, using the judged-similarity task, we asked participants to rate the degree to which each of the nine terms from the previous phase was associated with every other term and with the concept of “privacy.” Results from a correspondence analysis model suggest similarities in the mapping of terms related to “privacy” along the dichotomous dimension of physical vs. informational concerns. However, cultural differences emerged in a second dimension, the extent to which individualism vs. collectivism was stressed. While “personal privacy” and an individual’s relationship with the government was important for American adults, the main focus for Iranian adults was “familial privacy” and family-centered living.",2019-07-04,2020-02-04T06:36:32Z,2020-02-04T06:37:10Z,2020-02-04T06:36:31Z,357-370,NA,4,159,NA,NA,Cultural differences in conceptual representation of “Privacy”,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,NA,PMID: 30095370,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NT3EZFG9\Zabihzadeh et al. - 2019 - Cultural differences in conceptual representation .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\66AWBQQX\00224545.2018.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,cultural differences; Correction; Conceptual representation; privacy; semantic structure,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001168

In Study 1 (N = 64,228), using a multilevel approach with an international database, we found that older age was associated with lower well-being in countries higher in uncertainty avoidance but not in countries lower in uncertainty avoidance. Further, this cultural variation was mediated by a sense of control. In Study 2 (N = 1,025), we compared a culture with low uncertainty avoidance (the United States) with a culture with high uncertainty avoidance (Romania) and found a consistent pattern: Age was negatively associated with well-being in Romania but not in the United States.

Connectivity-based MRI measures have emerged as a way to study how recovery from brain injury is modulated by changes in intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity. Here we report a detailed and multi-modal case study of a 26 year-old male who presented with a left inferior parietal glioma infiltrating the left arcuate fasciculus. The patient underwent pre- and post-operative functional MRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging, as well as behavioral assessments of language, motor, vision and praxis. The surgery for removal of the tumor was carried out with the patient awake, and direct electrical stimulation mapping was used to evaluate cortical language centers. The patient developed a specific difficulty with repeating sentences toward the end of the surgery, after resection of the tumor and partial transection of the arcuate fasciculus.

However, emerging work now shows that individuals' brain responses can vary systematically in both the size and type of effect elicited. The present research therefore examined individual differences in neural activity elicited by grammatical agreement anomalies during language comprehension in a large cohort of highly literate, monolingual English speakers (N = 114), a population generally assumed to be relatively homogenous in terms of linguistic knowledge and processing. Results showed systematic variability in event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by subject-verb agreement anomalies, with brain responses varying on a continuum between N400 and P600 dominant responses. Similar variation was found both when agreement was realized via inflectional morphology or via lexical alternations. Individuals' brain response type correlated strongly across these two conditions. Similar variation was also found for ERPs elicited during rapid serial visual presentation and when self-paced ERPs were recorded. Multilevel latent variable regression showed that variation in brain response amplitude and type was not related to individual differences in language experience or verbal working memory capacity, despite high statistical power. These findings indicate that descriptions of processing dynamics predicated solely on grand mean analyses of central tendency can fail to provide an accurate, generalizable account of how processing unfolds in many or most individual members of the population studied. Furthermore, these findings show that systematic individual variation in engagement of neural system supporting grammatical processing is found even in language users at the highest end of the proficiency spectrum and in grammatically simple sentences. This study therefore has implications for studies of language processing in atypical populations.",2019-02-01,2020-02-07T06:19:54Z,2020-02-07T06:20:31Z,2020-02-07T06:19:54Z,210-237,NA,NA,111,NA,Cortex,Robust neurocognitive individual differences in grammatical agreement processing,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TXC9RHG5\Tanner - 2019 - Robust neurocognitive individual differences in gr.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MP8PK7H3\S0010945218303447.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Individual differences; ERP; Grammatical agreement; LAN; N400; P600,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001176

Test-trial response times revealed a striking similarity between the physical distribution of colors and their internal representations.

This apparent lack of concern has been attributed to people's deeply-entrenched belief in economic mobility – the belief that through hard work, determination, and skill people are able to rise up the economic ladder. Little is known, however, about why Americans so strongly believe in economic mobility. In five studies (N = 3112, including two pre-registered studies, one with a large, income-stratified sample), I examine the relationship between economic inequality and the belief in economic mobility. I find that people (accurately) perceive a negative relationship between economic inequality and economic mobility, and that this is due to the attributions they make about wealth and poverty. As economic inequality rises, people increasingly attribute economic success and failure to external factors that are beyond a person's control (vs. internal dispositions), and therefore expect economic mobility to drop. As a consequence, people's tendency to underestimate economic inequality reinforces their belief in economic mobility. I discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of lay beliefs about the economic system and public opinion regarding inequality.",2018-11-01,2019-03-30T16:57:28Z,2019-03-30T16:57:49Z,2019-03-30T16:57:28Z,138-148,NA,NA,79,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Why do Americans believe in economic mobility?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GA8GLQG3\Davidai - 2018 - Why do Americans believe in economic mobility Eco.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\THTRP49W\S002210311830146X.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Economic inequality; Economic mobility; Judgment and decision making; Poverty; Wealth,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001179

These issues have been the focus of recent debate within the research literature on the Dark Triad, which is a collection of interrelated but theoretically distinct personality constructs made up of narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy. The present paper highlights previous work on the issue of partialling and also makes use of recent developments surrounding meta?analytic structural equation modelling to reliably assess the impact of partialling on the empirical profiles of the Dark Triad components. The results show that numerous interpretive difficulties arise after partialling the overlap among the Dark Triad components, most notably for narcissism and Machiavellianism. The results are discussed in the context of contemporary Dark Triad research in addition to discussing the implications for structural equation modelling methods in personality psychology more generally. Recommendations are made for how future research can mitigate the interpretive difficulties that may arise from partialling.

The current work investigates this trade-off by comparing speaker variability effects on L2 vocabulary learning in different age groups. Existing literature suggests that speaker variability benefits L2 vocabulary learning in adults, but this may not be the case for younger learners. In this study native English-speaking adults, 7- to 8-year-olds, and 10- to 11-year-olds learned six novel Lithuanian words from a single speaker, and six from eight speakers. In line with previous research, adults showed better production of the multispeaker items at test. No such benefit was found for either group of children, either in production or comprehension.

Importantly, the activation of embodied object representations depends on contextual information. In the present study, we use a visual masking paradigm to investigate how the availability of visual information modulates the role of manipulability in the representation of object concepts. Using both an object naming task (i.e., linguistic response) and a picture-word matching task (i.e., manual response), we provide evidence that structural manipulability (the ability to pick up an object with one hand) and functional manipulability (the action information that pertains to the ultimate use of the object) have dissociable effects on object identification. In both tasks, the effects of structural manipulability were greater when structural information was available in the image (i.e., when the objects were unmasked); in contrast, the effects of functional manipulability were greater when the objects were masked. Importantly, these effects were not due to object familiarity or the age at which the name of the objects was acquired. Our results are consistent with the activation of the two pathways within the dorsal visual stream that are part of a distributed neural network that represents embodied action information.

Over a 10-year period, we investigated the associations between perceived partner responsiveness—the extent to which people feel understood, cared for, and appreciated by their romantic partners—and diurnal cortisol in a large sample of married and cohabitating couples in the United States. Partner responsiveness predicted higher cortisol values at awakening and steeper (i.e., healthier) cortisol slopes at the 10-year follow-up. These associations remained strong after we controlled for demographic factors, depressive symptoms, agreeableness, and other positive and negative relationship factors. Furthermore, declines in negative affect over the 10-year period mediated the prospective association between responsiveness and cortisol slope. These findings suggest that diurnal cortisol may be a key biological pathway through which social relationships affect long-term health.",2015-07-01,2018-03-20T04:44:45Z,2018-03-20T04:44:56Z,2018-03-20T04:44:44Z,972-982,NA,7,26,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J75C8YVV\Slatcher et al. - 2015 - Perceived Partner Responsiveness Predicts Diurnal .pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001186

Prior studies have suggested that exposure to sexist humor leads men who are high in hostile sexism to behave in a discriminatory manner toward women, and feel less ashamed for doing so (Ford, Boxer, Armstrong, & Edel, 2008). It was therefore predicted that sexist and rape jokes would increase rape myth acceptance and sexist behavior. Participants were 96 undergraduates. In partial support of predictions, sexist jokes increased rape myth acceptance among high-hostile sexist men more than nonsexist jokes, F(1, 42) = 5.58, p = .02, ηP2 = .12. Additionally, among participants high in hostile sexism, sexist jokes increased rape myth acceptance more in men than in women, F(1, 42) = 4.97, p = .03, ηP2 = .11. However, there was no evidence to suggest that sexist jokes increased sexist behavior by making participants less likely to donate to a women’s organization.

This process is partially supported by statistical learning, the ability to extract patterns from the environment. Given that speech segmentation represents a potential bottleneck for language acquisition, patterns in speech may be extracted very rapidly, without extensive exposure. This hypothesis was examined by exposing participants to continuous speech streams composed of novel repeating nonsense words. Learning was measured on-line using a reaction time task. After merely one exposure to an embedded novel word, learners demonstrated significant learning effects, as revealed by faster responses to predictable than to unpredictable syllables. These results demonstrate that learners gained sensitivity to the statistical structure of unfamiliar speech on a very rapid timescale. This ability may play an essential role in early stages of language acquisition, allowing learners to rapidly identify word candidates and “break in” to an unfamiliar language.",2017-07-01,2018-03-20T00:21:22Z,2018-03-20T00:21:41Z,2018-03-20T00:21:22Z,921-928,NA,7,28,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\DDZYJ3IH\Batterink - 2017 - Rapid Statistical Learning Supporting Word Extract.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001188

Driven by the requirements of energy impact modellers, policymakers and building design experts; a new historical high-spatial resolution, global gridded dataset of degree-days constructed using various base (threshold) temperatures (Tb) is presented in this study. Derived using sub-daily temperature from a quality-controlled reanalysis data product (Global Land Data Assimilation System—GLDAS), the dataset called ‘DegDays_0p25_1970_2018’ includes monthly and annual (i) CDD; (ii) HDD; and (iii) CDD computed using wet-bulb temperature (CDDwb) at 0.25° × 0.25° gridded resolution, covering 49 years over the period 1970–2018.

Further analysis showed no influence of degree of challenge, player age, nor prevalence of female role models in national chess leagues on differences in performance when women play men versus when they play women.

To this end, we used eye tracking with a rewarded visual search task and compared performance under conditions of high and low working memory load. In two experiments, we demonstrated that oculomotor capture by high-reward distractor stimuli is enhanced under high memory load.

Cue validity (how often a cue was present and correct) and dominance were also manipulated. In Experiment 1, where the morphological cues were low in validity but highly dominant, VIE helped participants to acquire and strengthen one morphological cue (case marking) but not the other (verb agreement).

However, credulity entails risks. The optimal level of credulity depends on the relative costs of believing misinformation and failing to attend to accurate information. When information concerns hazards, erroneous incredulity is often more costly than erroneous credulity, given that disregarding accurate warnings is more harmful than adopting unnecessary precautions. Because no equivalent asymmetry exists for information concerning benefits, people should generally be more credulous of hazard information than of benefit information. This adaptive negatively biased credulity is linked to negativity bias in general and is more prominent among people who believe the world to be more dangerous. Because both threat sensitivity and beliefs about the dangerousness of the world differ between conservatives and liberals, we predicted that conservatism would positively correlate with negatively biased credulity.

But what happens when powerful people also are ambivalent? On the basis of the self-validation theory of judgment, we hypothesized that power and ambivalence would interact to predict individuals’ action. Because power can validate individuals’ reactions, we reasoned that feeling powerful strengthens whatever reactions people have during a decision. It can strengthen univalent reactions and increase action orientation, as shown in past research. Among people who hold an ambivalent judgment, however, those who feel powerful would be less action oriented than those who feel powerless.

On one hand, research has suggested that framing effects evolve through the deliberation process, growing larger with time. On the other hand, dual-process theory attributes framing effects to an intuitive, emotional system that responds automatically to stimuli. In our experiments, participants made decisions about gambles framed in terms of either gains or losses, and time pressure was manipulated across blocks.

Similar to some repetitive behaviors in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), premonitory urges are assumed to play a critical role in maintaining skin picking behavior, by creating a vicious cycle. The present study is the first to investigate the quality of premonitory urges, as well as the temporal relationship between urges and skin picking behavior in individuals with skin picking disorder. Quality and intensity of premonitory urges was assessed in 15 individuals with skin picking. Urge quality was assessed with the translated University of São Paulo Sensory Phenomena Scale (USP-SPS). Urge intensity was assessed continuously over 20 min using a computer-based tool. Participants were instructed either a) to pick freely or b) to suppress their skin picking behavior. Skin picking events during the free and suppression condition were recorded on video and coded manually. Regarding the types of urges, individuals with skin picking reported mainly physical urge sensations (80%), visual ”just-right” feelings (80%), and urge-only sensations (80%) similar to urges reported by GTS and OCD patients. Moreover, the data showed a strong temporal relationship between the intensity of premonitory urges and the emergence of skin picking behavior (R2 = .23) that was weakened when skin picking was suppressed (R2 = .06). The results suggest that skin picking behavior is maintained by premonitory urges and that this vicious cycle of negative reinforcement can be, at least partially, broken by suppressing skin picking behavior.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:07:35Z,2020-01-30T11:29:16Z,2020-01-30T08:07:34Z,125-134,NA,NA,121,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9WRBMUUG\Dieringer et al. - 2019 - Quality and temporal properties of premonitory urg.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MB38FF9X\S0010945219303041.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Body focused repetitive behavior; Excoriation disorder; Exposure with response prevention; Premonitory urge; Skin picking,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001203

Optogenetics, on the other hand, has revolutionized the field of neuroscience. It was previously coupled with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques in rodents enabling population-specific targeting of cells, investigating brain networks with unprecedented in vivo precision. The coupling of optogenetics and 1H-fMRS is expected to enhance the specificity of metabolic readouts to validate neuro-energetic theories underlying brain activity. To date, the feasibility of combining optogenetic stimulation with fMRS has not been explored. We used green laser stimulation delivered through an optical fiber implanted superficially above the primary somatosensory forelimb cortex (S1FL) of rats expressing the C1V1 opsin in excitatory neurons. A protocol for the acquisition of functional 1H MR spectra upon optogenetic stimulation without craniotomy-induced artefacts was established. Quantification of metabolite concentrations in S1FL upon optogenetic and electrical forepaw stimulation demonstrated significantly increased glutamate levels (+8.8% and +9.9%, p < 0.05 respectively), which were compensated by decreased glutamine levels (−17% and −18%, p < 0.05 respectively). Our results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of combining optogenetic control and functional MR spectroscopy (o-fMRS) in the rat somatosensory cortex, opening new possibilities for monitoring the energetic demands of specific cell populations and for exploring the underpinnings of energy metabolism during brain activity.

People interpret accessible time metrics in two ways: If preparation for the future is under way (Studies 1 and 2), people interpret metrics as implying when a future event will occur. If preparation is not under way (Studies 3–5), they interpret metrics as implying when preparation should start (e.g., planning to start saving 4 times sooner for a retirement in 10,950 days instead of 30 years). Time metrics mattered not because they changed how distal or important future events felt (Study 6), but because they changed how connected and congruent their current and future selves felt (Study 7).",2015-06-01,2018-03-20T04:52:32Z,2018-04-04T00:53:56Z,2018-03-20T04:52:32Z,816-825,NA,6,26,NA,Psychol Sci,When Does the Future Begin?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CEMGFX92\Neil A.

A promising line of recent inquiry has been the low levels of women's elected representation in many democracies. We test the hypothesis that higher levels of women's elected representation will increase women's political knowledge. Using two large, comparative data sets, we find that the proportion of women elected representatives at the time of the survey has no significant effect on the gender gap. By contrast, there is a strong and significant long-term impact for descriptive representation when respondents were aged 18 to 21. The results are in line with political socialization, which posits that the impact of political context is greatest during adolescence and early adulthood.

Students’ learning patterns were primarily associated with their emotional states (anxiety vs. enjoyment) and secondarily with their motivational dispositions (clear vision of ideal future selves). Students’ anxiety together with weaker Ideal L2 Self related negatively to their performance at the beginning of the project—performance that they had achieved after several years of EFL instruction. Students’ enjoyment together with greater Ideal L2 Self predicted the extent to which they practiced and developed their L2 speech within the 3-month framework of the project. Results suggest that more frequent L2 use with positive emotions directly impacts acquisition, which may in turn lead to the lessening of negative emotions and better long-term L2 comprehensibility.

To test this hypothesis we here present a thorough investigation on the pathological and functional changes undergone by chromaffin cells (CCs) from 2-month (2 m) to 7-month (7 m) aged wild-type (WT) and R6/1 mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD), stimulated with acetylcholine (ACh) or high [K+] (K+). In order to do this, we used different techniques such as inmunohistochemistry, patch-clamp, and amperometric recording. With respect to WT cells, some of the changes next summarized were already observed in HD mice at a pre-disease stage (2 m); however, they were more pronounced at 7 m when motor deficits were clearly established, as follows: (i) huntingtin over-expression as nuclear aggregates in CCs; (ii) smaller CC size with decreased dopamine ?-hydroxylase expression, indicating lesser number of chromaffin secretory vesicles; (iii) reduced adrenal tissue catecholamine content; (iv) reduced Na+ currents with (v) membrane hyperpolarization and reduced ACh-evoked action potentials; (v) reduced [Ca2+]c transients with faster Ca2+ clearance; (vi) diminished quantal secretion with smaller vesicle quantal size; (vii) faster kinetics of the exocytotic fusion pore, pore expansion, and closure. On the basis of these data, the hypothesis is here raised in the sense that nuclear deposition of mutated huntingtin in adrenal CCs of R6/1 mice could be primarily responsible for poorer Na+ channel expression and function, giving rise to profound depression of cell excitability, altered Ca2+ handling and exocytosis.

Upgrading is most likely when a firm's products exhibit significant cross-market differences in markups, making accessing high-standards overseas markets particularly profitable. Additionally, upgrading is more likely when lead firms attach a high salience to labor standards. Therefore, while participation in global production induces “trading up” behaviors among firms overall, the effect strength varies across industries. We test our expectations via a survey experiment, which queries foreign firms operating in Vietnam about their willingness to invest in labor-related upgrading.

Accordingly, one might expect that ideological uncertainty would lead individuals to engage more deeply with the political domain in order to acquire a sufficient level of subjective certainty that the ideological orientation they have adopted is the “right” one. Given the inherent complexity and ambiguity of the political realm, however, we propose that ideological uncertainty should instead undermine political efficacy and interest, thereby motivating individuals to disengage and withdrawal from participating in electoral politics. Using both correlational and experimental methods, we conduct four studies on both convenience and representative samples in the context of two electoral contexts to test this hypothesis. Study 1 (N = 343) and Study 2 (N = 1054) demonstrate that ideological uncertainty covaries with reduced levels of political engagement and participation in the 2012 and 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, respectively. Study 3 (N = 170) and Study 4 (N = 798) replicate and extend the results of Study 1 and 2 by experimentally manipulating ideological uncertainty using an original and innovative false-feedback paradigm. We demonstrate the causal effect of ideological uncertainty on political engagement (independent of demographic variables, political knowledge, and ideological extremity and conviction), and find that it is particularly pronounced among individuals who reflect on the meaning of their political judgment and behaviors for their political orientation.

The results showed that for those who reported losses of an experience or cherished material object, perpetrators’ offers of compensation did not facilitate forgiveness. In Study 2, by manipulating replaceability of hypothetical losses in vignettes, we showed that compensation for replaceable losses effectively elicits forgiveness from a victim, but compensation for irreplaceable losses is ineffective.

Specifically, changes in intonational pitch along a sentence can affect our understanding of who did what to whom. To date, it remains unclear how the brain processes this particular use of intonation and which brain regions are involved. In particular, one central matter of debate concerns the lateralisation of intonation processing. To study the role of intonation in sentence comprehension, we designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment in which participants listened to spoken sentences. Critically, the interpretation of these sentences depended on either intonational or grammatical cues. Our results showed stronger functional activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) when the intonational cue was crucial for sentence comprehension compared to when it was not. When instead a grammatical cue was crucial for sentence comprehension, we found involvement of an overlapping region in the left IFG, as well as in a posterior temporal region. A further analysis revealed that the lateralisation of intonation processing depends on its role in syntactic processing: activity in the IFG was lateralised to the left hemisphere when intonation was the only source of information to comprehend the sentence. In contrast, activity in the IFG was right-lateralised when intonation did not contribute to sentence comprehension. Together, these results emphasise the key role of the left IFG in sentence comprehension, showing the importance of this region when intonation establishes sentence structure. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for the theory that the lateralisation of prosodic processing is modulated by its linguistic role.",2019-08-01,2020-01-30T07:15:21Z,2020-01-30T07:15:42Z,2020-01-30T07:15:21Z,122-134,NA,NA,117,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XSYUA97T\van der Burght et al. - 2019 - Intonation guides sentence processing in the left .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XB67UD84\S0010945219300632.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,fMRI; Lateralisation; Prosody; Sentence comprehension; Syntax,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001222

Motivation can modulate these changes. Specifically, when a cue indicates that a reward can be obtained, CS excitability initially increases, followed by a pronounced decrease. This dynamic could reflect processes related to reward expectancy, processes related to action preparation, or a combination of both. Here we set up two experiments to dissociate these accounts. A rewarded choice reaction time task was used in which individuals were cued at the beginning of each trial whether or not a response would be required at target onset and whether or not a reward could be obtained. We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) over the left primary motor cortex (M1) early (shortly after cue onset) or late (shortly before target onset) preceding target onset to examine CS excitability during motivated action preparation. Electromyography (EMG) was obtained from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. In the first experiment, we used a lenient response deadline, whereas a strict response time-out procedure was employed in the second experiment. Reward modulated CS excitability differentially only in the second experiment: CS excitability was highest during reward anticipation for the early stimulation epoch and was reduced for the late stimulation epoch when individuals were required to prepare a response, while CS excitability remained unchanged during non-reward anticipation. Our findings suggest that the reward effect on CS excitability is dependent on the actual implementation of effort to attain reward (i.e., the preparation of an actual action), as well as on temporal requirements (i.e., time pressure) invoked by the task.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:56:08Z,2020-01-30T11:28:17Z,2020-01-30T07:56:08Z,159-168,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2CABTSBK\Bundt et al. - 2019 - Reward anticipation changes corticospinal excitabi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9WKTNX76\S0010945219302321.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Primary motor cortex; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Corticospinal excitability; Response preparation; Reward,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001227

Some have argued that early life SES can fundamentally shift time preferences per se, such that those from low SES backgrounds favor current rewards over future rewards. Others have argued that, while early life SES has lasting effects on behavior, such effects are only observable in the presence of salient cues to mortality. Here, we propose an alternative framework that centers on environmental uncertainty. In this uncertainty management framework, early life deprivation promotes the development of strategies that minimize the downside costs of uncertainty across domains. We argue that this focus on managing uncertainty results in greater risk-aversion, present-orientation, and prosociality. Furthermore, these effects need not be dependent on salient cues to mortality. Across four large samples of participants (total N = 4714), we find that childhood deprivation uniquely predicts greater risk-aversion (both incentivized and hypothetical) and greater prosociality in economic games. Childhood deprivation also predicts greater present-orientation, but not above-and beyond current SES. We further find that mortality cues are not necessary to elicit these differences. Our results support an uncertainty management perspective on the effects of childhood SES on risk, time, and social preferences.",2018-11-01,2019-03-30T17:00:52Z,2019-03-30T17:00:59Z,2019-03-30T17:00:52Z,217-226,NA,NA,79,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,An uncertainty management perspective on long-run impacts of adversity,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\JLDQLUP3\Amir e.a. - 2018 - An uncertainty management perspective on long-run .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\BB8JV827\S0022103118301082.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Socioeconomic status; Dictator Game; Early life environment; Economic games; Experimental game theory; Ultimatum Game,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001231

As with other sources of international finance, such as foreign direct investment and foreign aid, worker remittances shape politics in recipient countries. We examine the political consequences of remittances by exploring how they influence antigovernment protest behavior. While recent research argues that remittances have a pernicious effect on politics by contributing to authoritarian stability, we argue the opposite: Remittances increase political protest in nondemocracies by augmenting the resources available to potential political opponents. Using cross-national data on a latent measure of antigovernment political protest, we show that remittances increase protest. To explore the mechanism linking remittances to protest, we turn to individual-level data from eight nondemocracies in Africa to show that remittance receipt increases protest in opposition areas but not in progovernment regions.",2018-10-01,2019-03-20T11:44:15Z,2019-03-20T11:44:33Z,2019-03-20T11:44:15Z,889-904,NA,4,62,NA,American Journal of Political Science,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QCQ8DEK6\Escribà-Folch e.a. - 2018 - Remittances and Protest in Dictatorships.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7CT9X2VK\ajps.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001233

To examine this possibility, in the first study, we presented Latina women with a fictional STEM company and a scientist working at the company who was either Latino/a or a non-Latino/a White man or woman. We found that compared to those in the White man or woman scientist conditions, participants in the Latino/a scientist conditions believed the scientist had faced comparable adversity to themselves, identified more strongly with the scientist, and reported higher trust and belonging and attraction to the STEM company. Using the findings from Study 1 to inform a new intervention, in the second study we presented Latina high school students with a panel of Latina scientists. Relative to before the panel, the students reported enhanced feelings of trust and belonging in STEM after the panel. Exploratory analyses further revealed that among Latina students who did not already intend to pursue a career in STEM, the panel encouraged their interest in the sciences.

When assessed during the resting state, it is regarded as an index of trait approach and withdrawal motivation. However, the replicability of these associations with personality is currently unclear. The present meta-analysis seeks to provide a comprehensive quantitative review of the relationship between personality traits and resting electroencephalographic (EEG) frontal asymmetry. We distinguished five personality clusters: extraversion, neuroticism, impulsivity, anger, and defensiveness. Data from 79 independent samples with overall 5700 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The results revealed that less than 0.4% of the variance in extraversion and neuroticism could be explained by resting frontal asymmetry. Similarly, a small effect was observed for trait anger, and a small-sized to medium-sized effect was observed for defensiveness, although the number of studies was very low. No significant effect emerged for impulsivity. The effects were further reduced after adjustment for publication bias. Given some evidence for heterogeneity, sub-traits were analysed, and methodological moderators were investigated. Based on the results, we conclude that the validity of resting frontal asymmetry as a marker for personality is not supported. Finally, recommendations are given to increase the replicability of frontal asymmetry research. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:33:08Z,2020-01-30T12:35:13Z,2020-01-30T12:33:07Z,154-175,NA,2,33,NA,NA,Resting Frontal EEG Asymmetry and Personality Traits,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6T67EJIS\Kuper et al. - 2019 - Resting Frontal EEG Asymmetry and Personality Trai.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9Q95886N\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,meta-analysis; personality traits; EEG; frontal asymmetry; resting state,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001238

While contemporary models consider hoarding and obsessive-compulsive disorder distinct, the related behaviours have not been separately examined in patients with FTD, and the neuroanatomical correlates of hoarding in patients with FTD have not been previously examined (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Grisham and Baldwin, 2015; Mataix-Cols et al., 2010). Methods Patients with FTD who were evaluated between 2004 and 2018 at our centre were included. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumetric analyses were completed on available T1 high resolution anatomic scans using FreeSurfer. Results Eighty-seven patients met inclusion criteria, and 49 had scans available for quantitative MRI volumetric analysis. New hoarding behaviours were present in 29% of patients and were more common in the semantic variant subtype of FTD, while 49% of individuals had new or increased OCB. Hoarding behaviours were associated with decreased thickness in a factor comprised of left temporal, insular and anterior cingulate cortices. The presence of OCB was predicted by reduced cortical thickness and volumes in a factor comprised of the anterior cingulate and subcortical volumes in the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus. OCB were associated with greater right temporal cortical thickness in comparison to patients with hoarding. Discussion The association of the semantic variant with hoarding, together with the observed associations between left temporal atrophy and hoarding indicate that degeneration of the left temporal lobe has a role in the emergence of hoarding in FTD. As in current models of Hoarding disorder and Obsessive–Compulsive disorder, our results suggest that in patients with FTD, hoarding and OCB are clinically and anatomically partially dissociable phenomenon. The results may also help to further elucidate the cognitive processes and neural networks contributing to Hoarding disorder and Obsessive–Compulsive disorder in persons without dementia.",2019-12-01,2020-01-30T08:09:09Z,2020-01-30T12:00:19Z,2020-01-30T08:09:08Z,443-453,NA,NA,121,NA,Cortex,Hoarding and obsessive–compulsive behaviours in frontotemporal dementia,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2TY3YXYL\Mitchell et al. - 2019 - Hoarding and obsessive–compulsive behaviours in fr.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FMQ37VJA\S001094521930334X.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Frontotemporal dementia; Hoarding; Neuropsychiatry; Obsessive-compulsive; Semantic variant,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001239

In a cross-sectional study, 124 PD patients underwent extensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment as well as a 3T MRI scan of the brain. Our aim was to identify differences in grey matter volume and thickness, as well as cortical folding, across different cognitive profiles as defined through a data-driven exploratory cluster analysis of neuropsychological data. The identified cognitive groups ranged from cognitively intact patients to patients with severe deficits in all cognitive domains, whilst showing comparable levels of motor disability and disease duration. Each group was compared to the cognitively intact PD group using voxel- and vertex-based morphometry. Results revealed widespread age-related grey matter abnormalities associated with progressive worsening of cognitive functions in mild PD. When adjusted for age, significant differences were only seen between cognitively intact and severely affected PD patients and these were restricted to the right posterior cingulate and the right precuneus.

Such reliance on object-based representations would predict that after an object is fully encoded into VWM, all features of that object would need to be maintained as a coherent unit. Here, we evaluated this idea by testing whether memory resources can be redeployed to a specific feature of an object already stored in VWM. We found that observers can utilize a retrospective cue presented during the maintenance period to attenuate both the gradual deterioration and complete loss of memory for a cued feature over time, but at the cost of accelerated loss of information regarding the uncued feature. Our findings demonstrate that object representations held within VWM can be decomposed into individual features and that having to retain additional features imposes greater demands on active maintenance processes.",2017-12-01,2018-03-19T23:49:41Z,2018-03-19T23:49:52Z,2018-03-19T23:49:41Z,1773-1785,NA,12,28,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LEDT79J9\Park et al. - 2017 - Reprioritization of Features of Multidimensional O.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001243

We argue that this pre-aggregation is less innocuous than it seems, costing applied researchers opportunities for improved inference. First, researchers cannot evaluate the consequences of different methods of report aggregation. Second, aggregation discards report-level information (i.e., variation across reports) that is useful in addressing measurement error inherent in event data. Therefore, we advocate that data should be supplied and analyzed at the report level. We demonstrate the consequences of using aggregated event data as a predictor or outcome variable, and how analysis can be improved using report-level information directly.

This study examined the effects of blocking and interleaving on L2 grammar learning. In this study, 115 Japanese learners studied 5 English grammatical structures under 1 of 3 conditions: blocking, interleaving, and increasing (i.e., blocking followed by interleaving). Learning was measured using a grammaticality judgment test administered immediately and 1 week after the treatment. Although interleaving led to the highest number of incorrect responses during training, it was more effective than blocking in the 1-week delayed posttest. These results indicate that the advantage of interleaving extends to L2 grammar learning. Furthermore, learners’ levels of prior knowledge were found to moderate the effects of interleaving. Specifically, participants with lower pretest scores benefited more from interleaving compared to those with higher pretest scores.

Despite this common basis, recent research has shown that the consistency of people's choices across different mixed-motive games is rather low. The present research examined behavioural consistency within the same mixed-motive game, by presenting participants with a series of one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma Games. Across this set of games, payoffs were manipulated in order to intensify or weaken the conflict between self and the other party while maintaining the game's underlying structure. Our findings indicate that significant differences in choice behaviour are observed as a function of both situational (i.e. manipulations of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game's payoff structure) and personality differences (i.e. individual differences in personality and motivational traits). Moreover, our included situational variables and personality features did not interact with each other and were about equally impactful in shaping cooperation. Crucially, however, despite the significant behavioural differences across game variants, considerable consistency in choices was found as well, which suggests that the game's motivational basis reliably impacts choice behaviour in spite of situational and personality variations.

Using self-reports from over 3000 representative German twin pairs of three birth cohorts, we could replicate previous findings on the primary role of genetic sources accounting for the unfolding of inter-individual differences in personality traits and stabilizing trait differences during adolescence. More specifically, the genetic variance increased between early (ages 10–12 years) and late (ages 16–18 years) adolescence and stabilized between late adolescence and young adulthood (ages 21–25 years). This trend could be confirmed in a second three-wave longitudinal study of adolescents' personality self-reports and parent ratings from about 1400 Norwegian twin families (average ages between 15 and 20 years). Moreover, the longitudinal study provided evidence for increasing genetic differences being primarily due to accumulation of novel genetic influences instead of an amplification of initial genetic variation. This is in line with cumulative interaction effects between twins' correlated genetic makeups and environmental circumstances shared by adolescent twins reared together. In other words, nature × nurture interactions rather than transactions can account for increases in genetic variance and thus personality variance during adolescence. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:38:35Z,2020-01-30T12:41:59Z,2020-01-30T12:38:35Z,221-244,NA,3,33,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VBLGPRWK\Kandler et al. - 2019 - Unravelling the Interplay Between Genetic and Envi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HNA7GM5L\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,twin study; adolescence; genetic and environmental variance; genotype × environment transaction and interaction; personality differences,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001250

First, they can display different trajectories (e.g., increases or decreases) on constructs of interest. Second, the configuration of group members’ responses within a group can change, such that the members become more or less similar to each other. Psychologists have historically been interested in understanding changes in groups over time; however, there is currently no comprehensive quantitative framework for studying and modeling group processes over time. We present a multilevel framework for such research—the multilevel group-process framework (MGPF). The MGPF builds on a statistical approach developed to capture whether individual members of a group develop a shared climate over time, but we extend the core ideas in two important ways. First, we describe how researchers can gain insights into group phenomena such as group leniency, group learning, groupthink, group extremity, group forming, group freezing, and group adjourning through modeling change in latent mean levels and consensus. Second, we present a sequence of model-testing steps that enable researchers to systematically study and contrast different group processes.

The present research proposes a conversational strategy that can help negotiators achieve both. Specifically, we show that using an offer framing strategy that shifts offer recipients' attention to their reservation price (e.g., “How does my offer compare to your minimum price?”) leads to both (a) an assimilation effect whereby recipients make more favorable counteroffers (economic benefit) as well as (b) a contrast effect whereby recipients feel more satisfied with the negotiation (relational benefit). We find evidence for the effectiveness of this conversational strategy across four experiments (N = 1522) involving different negotiation contexts (real estate, restaurant sale) and participant samples (MBAs, sales agents, online participants), and also document negotiator power as an important boundary condition. Overall, our research suggests that economic and relational benefits do not have to be mutually exclusive in distributive negotiations, that the perceived extremity of an offer is subjective and can be strategically influenced, and that assimilation and contrast effects can operate simultaneously when they relate to separate outcomes.",2020-03-01,2020-02-06T01:30:04Z,2020-02-06T01:31:23Z,2020-02-06T01:30:04Z,103943,NA,NA,87,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Win-win in distributive negotiations,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZNG7ZR7Q\Schaerer et al. - 2020 - Win-win in distributive negotiations The economic.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\8CC6APGE\S0022103119304524.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Power; Framing; Satisfaction; First offer; Negotiation; Reservation price,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001262

This study examined to which extent the neural processes involved in recognising personally familiar faces depend on attentional resources by analysing event-related brain potentials. In two experiments, participants were presented with multiple ambient images of highly personally familiar and unfamiliar faces and pictures of butterflies, with a letter string superimposed on each image. Their task was either to indicate when a butterfly occurred (effectively ignoring the letter strings) or to indicate whether each letter string contained the letter X or N. Attentional resource load was manipulated in the letter task by presenting the target among different distractor letters (high load; Experiment 1) or by using only a single repeated letter in each string (low load; Experiment 2). ERPs revealed more negative amplitudes for familiar relative to unfamiliar faces under both high and low load conditions, both in the N250, reflecting the activation of perceptual face representations, and in the subsequent Sustained Familiarity Effect (SFE). Nonetheless, while the magnitude of the N250 effect was not substantially affected by attentional load, the SFE was still present but reduced in the high relative to the low load experiment. These findings suggest that perceptual face representations are activated independent of the demands of a competing task. However, the subsequent SFE, presumably reflecting more sustained activation needed to access identity-specific knowledge that can guide potential interactions, strongly relies on the availability of attentional resources.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:56:19Z,2020-01-30T11:28:26Z,2020-01-30T07:56:19Z,147-158,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,Later but not early stages of familiar face recognition depend strongly on attentional resources,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ERH5BIXS\Wiese et al. - 2019 - Later but not early stages of familiar face recogn.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6YXY9NTD\S0010945219302357.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Face recognition; Event-related potentials; N250; Resource load; Sustained familiarity effect,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001263

Both types of feedback conveyed the correct answer, because there were only two answer choices. However, on a follow-up test, participants learned less from failure feedback than from success feedback. This effect was replicated across professional, linguistic, and social domains—even when learning from failure was less cognitively taxing than learning from success and even when learning was incentivized. Participants who received failure feedback also remembered fewer of their answer choices. Why does failure undermine learning? Failure is ego threatening, which causes people to tune out.

Prolonged impairment of astrocytic functions could increase the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), accelerate their degeneration and affect ability to compensate for partial degeneration at the presymptomatic stages of the disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the astrocyte depletion in the SN, its impact on the dopaminergic system functioning and multiple markers of energy metabolism during the early stages of neurodegeneration and compensation. We induced death of 30% of astrocytes by chronic infusion of fluorocitrate (FC) into the SN, simultaneously activating microglia response but sparing the dopaminergic neurons. The FC effect was reversible after toxin withdrawal. Dopaminergic neurons were killed by 6-hydroxydopamine causing transient locomotor disability, reversed with time showing compensatory potential. Death of astrocytes diminished the capability of the dopaminergic system to compensate for the degeneration of neurons and caused a local energy deprivation by decreasing lactate and glycogen amount. Studied markers suggest a shift in the usage of energy substrates, via increased glycogenolysis and glycolysis markers, ketone bodies availability and fatty acid transport in remaining cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1alpha) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the energy sensors, showed different regulation between the cell-types. Increased neuronal expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1c could play a role in the adaptation to metabolic stress in response to glia dysfunction. Astrocyte energetic support is one of the essential factors for neuronal compensatory mechanisms of dopaminergic system and might have a leading role in the presymptomatic Parkinson's disease stages.

A gating task was used to test intermediate L2 learners at two time points across a semester of classroom learning. Native Mandarin speakers (tested once) served as a control group. Mixed-effects modeling revealed that upon hearing truncated speech, L2 learners, like native speakers, identified high token frequency syllable–tone combinations more accurately than low token frequency syllable–tone combinations. Error analysis of correct syllable/incorrect tone responses revealed that native speakers made specific probability-based errors. L2 learners primarily demonstrated more acoustic-based errors but exhibited a trend toward greater probability-based errors during the second test.

However, knowledge of how they are actually being used has been lacking. Extracting data from published reports of 207 recent experiments, we provide an empirical review of current practices concerning manipulation checks in social psychology. Our review suggests that there are serious deficiencies in the manner in which manipulation checks are used and interpreted. For example, published reports tend to contain highly limited quantitative reasoning about the effectiveness of manipulations, and researchers report little or nothing to address the possibility that manipulation checks might cause undesirable reactivity among participants. However, we argue that manipulation checks can be highly beneficial components of experiments when used properly, and they have untapped potential for the quantitative assessment of the strength of manipulations relative to the effect on the dependent variable (i.e., causal efficacy). To assist with such assessments, we provide empirical benchmarks for causal efficacy in social psychology.

Similar alterations can, however, also be observed in cognitively intact older subjects and may prelude the clinical manifestation of AD. The objectives of this prospective cross-sectional study in a cohort of 38 cognitively intact older adults were twofold: (i) to investigate the latent relationship among cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers reflecting the main pathophysiological processes of AD, and (ii) to assess the correlation between these biomarkers and gray matter volume as well as amyloid load. All subjects underwent extensive neuropsychological examinations, CSF sampling, [18F]-flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography, and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. A factor analysis revealed one factor that explained most of the variance in the CSF biomarker dataset clustering t-tau, α-synuclein, p-tau181, neurogranin, BACE1, visinin-like protein 1, chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), A?1?40 and A?1?38. Higher scores on this factor correlated with lower gray matter volume and with higher amyloid load in the precuneus. At the level of individual CSF biomarkers, levels of visinin-like protein 1, neurogranin, BACE1, A?1?40, A?1?38, and YKL-40 all correlated inversely with gray matter volume of the precuneus. These findings demonstrate that in cognitively intact older subjects, CSF levels of synaptic and neuronal integrity biomarkers, amyloidogenic processing and measures of innate immunity (YKL-40) display a latent structure of common variance, which is associated with loss of structural integrity of brain regions implicated in the earliest stages of AD.

The onset of the selection negativity, an ERP component indexing attentional modulation, was about 60 msec earlier for trained than untrained stimuli. Trained stimuli also elicited centro-parietal N200 and N320 components that were insensitive to attentional feature selection. The scalp distribution and timecourse of these components were better matched by studies of orthography than object expertise. Source localization using eLORETA suggested that the strongest neural sources of the selection negativity were in right ventral temporal cortex whereas the strongest sources of the N200/N320 components were in left ventral temporal cortex, again consistent with the hypothesis that training recruited orthography related areas.

Previous work has shown that judging the gaze direction of a non-foveally presented face is facilitated when the eyes of that face are directed towards the centre of the scene. This finding has been interpreted as an example of the human bias for misattributing observed ambiguous gaze signals as self-directed eye-contact. To test this interpretation against an alternative hypothesis that the facilitation is instead driven by the establishment of joint attention, we conducted two experiments in which we varied the participants’ fixation location. In both experiments, we replicated the previous finding of facilitated gaze discrimination when the participants fixated centrally. However, this facilitation was abolished when participants fixated peripheral fixation crosses (Experiment 1) and reversed when participants fixated peripheral images of real-world objects (Experiment 2). Based on these data, we propose that the facilitation effect is consistent with the interpretation that gaze discrimination is facilitated when joint attention is established.

Upon crossing some threshold, neural signals are globally broadcast throughout the brain and allow conscious reports. However, whether subjective experience (phenomenal consciousness) is categorical (i.e., transitioning abruptly from unconscious to conscious states) or graded (i.e., characterized by multiple intermediate states) remains an open question. To address this issue, we built a series of artificial neural networks containing distinct feedback connectivity from “multisensory” to “unisensory” cortices. In line with consciousness theories, we operationalized perceptual consciousness by the presence of feedback from higher-order nodes back to unisensory nodes which allow ‘neural ignition’ – a rapid, non-linear boost in response putatively leading to phenomenal consciousness. When simulating how these networks responded to unisensory and multisensory inputs, we found the fastest responses for multisensory presentations associated with multisensory feedback, and the slowest responses for multisensory presentations without feedback. Most interestingly, despite being built in line with “all-or-none” models of consciousness, multisensory stimuli associated with unisensory feedback (i.e., auditory or visual), and hence consistent with unisensory phenomenology according to theories of consciousness, generated intermediate reaction times. To extend these models to human perception and performance, we conducted extensive psychophysical testing in 29 subjects who each completed 10 h of a multisensory cue-congruency task. Consistent with the modeling results, we found that reaction times to multisensory cues reported as unisensory were intermediate between those of fully aware and fully unaware cues. These results support the existence of graded forms of phenomenological consciousness that can be instantiated by simple neural networks built in line with “all-or-none” models of consciousness.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:55:57Z,2020-01-30T11:14:01Z,2020-01-30T07:55:56Z,169-180,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,Multisensory perceptual awareness,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XD8T7VVG\Noel et al. - 2019 - Multisensory perceptual awareness Categorical or .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\D77RU2U7\S0010945219302291.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Consciousness; Multisensory; Global neuronal workspace; Neural networks; Psychophysics,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001277

The most common method of analysis has been the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). The CLPM does not separate between-person effects from within-person effects, making it unclear whether the results from previous studies actually reflect the within-person effects or whether they reflect differences between people. We investigated the associations between self-esteem and depressive symptoms at the within-person level, using random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs). To get an impression of the magnitude of possible differences between the RI-CLPM and the CLPM, we compared the results of both models. We used data from three longitudinal adolescent samples (age range: 7?18 years; study 1: N = 1948; study 2: N = 1455; study 3: N = 316). Intervals between the measurements were 1?1.5 years. Single-paper meta-analyses showed support for small within-person associations from self-esteem to depressive symptoms, but not the other way around, thus only providing some support for the vulnerability model. The cross-lagged associations in the aggregated RI-CLPM and CLPM showed similar effect sizes. Overall, our results show that over 1- to 1.5-year time intervals, low self-esteem may negatively influence depressive symptoms over time within adolescents, but only weakly so. ? 2018 The Authors.

I show that the justice cascade has a differential effect on leaders based on their culpability (whether they presided over atrocity crimes). In the past, culpable and nonculpable leaders went into exile at virtually identical rates. Today, however, culpable leaders are about six times less likely to flee abroad because exile no longer guarantees a safe retirement. These findings raise stark implications for existing research that debates whether international justice deters atrocities or prolongs conflicts. My results about exiled leaders, I explain, imply that the justice cascade should deter atrocities and prolong conflicts.

Using a novel pupil dilation paradigm to tap cognitive effort, we exposed an ethnic minority group (Ntotal = 263) to depictions of their ingroup as disadvantaged or advantaged after they had stated four things they liked about their ethnic group (strong group identity salience) or grandmother (weak group identity salience).

Its converse is pity, a negative state elicited by downward comparisons towards worse-off others. Both classes of emotions first require us to infer what a person's life as a whole must be like. However, the “focusing illusion” suggests these impressions of others are incomplete: we may overweight extreme features (the exceptionally good circumstances of envied others and exceptionally bad circumstances of pitied others) at the cost of overlooking the smaller ups and downs of daily life, which inevitably dilute the other person's overall experience. If so, envy and pity could involve misperceiving that envied others have lives that are uniformly wonderful (overlooking that they still face smaller annoyances) and pitied others have lives that are uniformly awful (overlooking that they still enjoy smaller pleasures). Five studies support this possibility. First, participants evaluated different peers. Consistent with focalism, the more envy and pity they felt, the more disparities they perceived (Study 1)—yet the actual everyday lives of envied and pitied others were similar (Study 2). Participants then completed various defocusing tasks designed to bring to mind others' smaller ups and downs. This indeed reduced envy and pity (Studies 3–4a–4b–5), but pity proved harder to reduce (Studies 4b–5).

Second, using real as well as carefully simulated examples, we introduce and apply Bayesian methods to various research designs. Third, to promote the use of Bayesian methods in L2 research, we introduce a free Web-accessed point-and-click software package (https://rnorouzian.shinyapps.io/bayesian-t-tests) as well as a suite of flexible R functions developed by the first author.

Using a quasi-experimental design, the argument is tested with data on thousands of public works projects sanctioned by MPs in North India. The results show that, even controlling for unobserved differences in voter characteristics, MPs systematically favored the constituencies of co-partisan state legislators when allocating pork specifically under conditions implied by the argument and not otherwise.

Properly equipped international organizations, however, can mitigate these dilemmas by analyzing and acting on sensitive information while protecting it from wide dissemination. Using new data on intelligence disclosures to the International Atomic Energy Agency and an analysis of the full universe of nuclear proliferation cases, we demonstrate that strengthening the agency's intelligence protection capabilities led to greater intelligence sharing and fewer suspected nuclear facilities.

Relatedly, people rely more on affective processing when social distance is small in the life-saving domain, but not in the valuables-saving domain (Study 3). Furthermore, in the life-saving domain social distance exerts an effect on risk preference under affective processing but not under deliberate processing, whereas, in the valuables-saving domain, social distance influences risk preference under deliberate processing but not under affective processing (Study 4).

Narcissism is characterized by little empathy for the victim, which reduces guilt about one's transgressions. Low guilt, in turn, is associated with unwillingness to apologize. In Study 1, we assessed dispositional narcissism, empathy, guilt, and willingness to apologize. In Study 2, we assessed dispositional narcissism and obtained state measures of empathy, guilt, and willingness to apologize. In Study 3, we manipulated narcissism and collected state measures of empathy, guilt, and willingness to apologize. Narcissism was negatively associated with (Studies 1?2) and decreased (Study 3) willingness to apologize, with this link being explained (i.e., serially mediated) by low empathy and guilt. Finally, in Study 4, we showed that antagonistic narcissism (i.e., narcissistic rivalry), but not agentic narcissism (i.e., narcissistic admiration), was negatively associated with willingness to apologize and apologizing behaviour. In all, narcissists are unwilling to apologize for their transgressions, as they experience little empathy for their victims and lower guilt.

The metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) plays an important role in HD and we have recently demonstrated that mGluR5-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) can ameliorate pathology and the phenotypic signs of a mouse model of HD. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in mGluR5 PAMs effect on memory. Our results demonstrate that subchronic treatment with the mGluR5 PAM VU0409551 was effective in reversing the memory deficits exhibited by BACHD mice, a mouse model for HD. Moreover, VU0409551 treatment stabilized mGluR5 at the cellular plasma membrane of BACHD mice, increasing the expression of several genes important for synaptic plasticity, including c-Fos, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Arc/Arg3.1, syntaxin 1A, and post-synaptic density-95. In addition, VU0409551 treatment also increased dendritic spine density and maturation and augmented the number of pre-synaptic sites. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that VU0409551 triggered the activation of cell signaling pathways important for synaptic plasticity, enhancing the level of dendritic spine maturation and rescuing BACHD memory impairment.

Outstanding questions concern what causes excuse validation, and whether it is peculiar to American moral psychology or cross-culturally robust. The present paper studies the phenomenon cross-culturally, focusing on Korean and American adults, and proposes a new explanation of why people engage in excuse validation, in terms of competing forces in human norm-psychology. The principal findings are that Americans and Koreans engaged in excuse validation at similar levels, and older adults were more likely to engage in excuse validation.

An important and practically relevant question is whether some children are more vulnerable for the effects of psychologically controlling parenting. In the current diary study, we investigated whether daily psychologically controlling parenting relates to children's daily externalizing and internalizing problems and whether these associations depend on child personality. A total of 206 children (M age = 9.93 years; 46.6% female) along with their mothers and fathers (M age = 40.30 and 42.40 years) participated in this multi-informant diary study. All three family members filled out a diary each day for seven days. Multilevel analyses indicated that daily maternal and paternal psychological control were positively related to daily externalizing and internalizing problems, a pattern that was fairly consistent across informants. Out of the 35 interactions tested, only three turned out to be significant. Overall, the limited number of interactions suggests that psychologically controlling parenting is generally detrimental to children's daily functioning. Still, children differ somewhat in their susceptibility to the effect of psychologically controlling parenting. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2018-07-01,2019-03-20T17:34:58Z,2019-03-20T17:37:39Z,2019-03-20T17:34:58Z,459-479,NA,4,32,NA,European Journal of Personality,The Role of Child Personality in Effects of Psychologically Controlling Parenting,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HAKDCR4G\Mabbe e.a. - 2018 - The Role of Child Personality in Effects of Psycho.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\M9FTHQU6\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,personality; diary; parenting; psychological control,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001295

For second language (L2) grammar learning, some studies reveal advantages for spacing of 7 days or more, but others for shorter spacing. Further, little is known about the role of cognitive individual differences (e.g., language analytic ability; LAA) in mediating practice distribution effects for L2 grammatical knowledge development and retention. To address this gap, this classroom-based study investigated whether distribution of practice and LAA moderated the effectiveness of explicit, input-based grammar instruction for young first language (L1) English learners of French (aged 8 to 11). The study revealed minimal differences between longer (7-day) versus shorter (3.5-day) spacing of practice for learning a French verb inflection subsystem, at either posttest or delayed posttest. Minimal group-level gains and substantial within-group variation in performance at posttests were observed. Accuracy of practice during training and LAA were significantly associated with posttest performance under both practice schedules. These findings indicated that within an ecologically valid classroom context, differences in distribution of practice had limited impact on learner performance on our tests; rather, individual learner differences were more critical in moderating learning.

We tested three hypotheses. First, we predicted that need for closure would be more strongly related to political identity (symbolic ideology and party identification; Hypothesis 1) and issue positions (operational ideology; Hypothesis 2) among individuals who see their political preferences as more self-central. Then we predicted that the stronger relationship between need for closure and issue positions among individuals high in centrality would be accounted for by stronger relationships between need for closure and political identity and between political identity and issue positions (Hypothesis 3).

We found that experiencing inauthenticity, compared with authenticity, consistently led participants to feel more immoral and impure. This link from inauthenticity to feeling immoral produced an increased desire among participants to cleanse themselves and to engage in moral compensation by behaving prosocially. We established the role that impurity played in these effects through mediation and moderation. We found that inauthenticity-induced cleansing and compensatory helping were driven by heightened feelings of impurity rather than by the psychological discomfort of dissonance. Similarly, physically cleansing oneself eliminated the relationship between inauthenticity and prosocial compensation. Finally, we obtained additional evidence for discriminant validity: The observed effects on desire for cleansing were not driven by general negative experiences (i.e., failing a test) but were unique to experiences of inauthenticity.

However, the extent and circumstances under which these cortical networks overlap and/or interact remain unclear. Crucially, whereas previous studies employed experimental designs that tend to confound exogenous with endogenous attentional engagement, we used a cued target discrimination paradigm that behaviourally dissociates exogenous from endogenous attention processes. Participants engaged with endogenous attention cues, while simultaneous apparent motion cues were driving exogenous attention along the motion path towards or away from the target position. To interfere with dorsal or ventral attention networks, we delivered neuronavigated double-pulse TMS over either right intraparietal sulcus (rIPS) or right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) towards the end of the cue target interval, and compared the effects to a sham-TMS condition. For sham-TMS, endogenous and exogenous cueing both benefitted discrimination accuracy. Target discrimination was enhanced at validly versus invalidly cued locations (endogenous cueing benefit) as well as when targets appeared in versus out of the motion path (exogenous cueing benefit), despite motion being uninformative and task-irrelevant, replicating previous findings. Interestingly, both rIPS- and rTPJ-TMS abolished attention benefits from exogenous cueing, while endogenous cueing benefits were unaffected.

Judgements regarding hierarchical orderings tend to be faster and more accurate when the dominant element in any pair from the order (e.g., the older, richer) is presented on the left of the screen as compared with the right (left-anchoring effect). This signature effect is investigated in three conditions (Experiment 1), each implementing a different timing regime for the elements in each pair, during learning. Thereby, the construction of a mental representation of the ordering was exposed to a potentially competing spatial simulation, that is, the well-known “mental timeline” with orientation from left (present) to right (future). First, the left-anchoring effect for order representations remained significant when timeline information was congruent with the presumed left-anchoring process, that is, the dominant element in a pair was always presented first. Second, the same effect remained also significant when the timeline-related information was random, that is, the dominant element being presented either first or second. Third, the same effect was found to be still significant, when the timeline-related information was contrary to the left-anchoring process, that is, the dominant element being presented always second.

This article focuses on criminal violence and proposes a twofold mechanism to explain why peacekeeping missions, even when effectively reducing conflict, can inadvertently increase criminal violence. First, less conflict opens up economic opportunities (so-called peacekeeping economies) and provides operational security for organized crime, thus increasing violent competition among criminal groups. Second, demobilized combatants are vulnerable to turn to crime because of limited legal livelihood opportunities and their training in warfare. While UN troops may exacerbate these dynamics, UN police's peculiar role is likely to successfully contain criminal violence.

First, this produces an orientation effect: The same container is judged larger when right side up than when upside down because of the greater ease of imagining filling an upright container. Second, we identified a cavern effect: Imagining pouring water through a narrow opening toward a relatively wide base produces a sense that the container is cavernous and large (compared with identically sized, wide-topped, narrow-based containers).

Many scholars believe the answer to this question is that heuristics, biases, and ignorance cause voters to misperceive risk magnitudes. By contrast, this article argues that Americans’ risk priorities primarily reflect judgments about the extent to which some victims deserve more protection than others and the degree to which it is appropriate for government to intervene in different areas of social life. The article supports this argument with evidence drawn from a survey with 3,000 respondents, using pairwise comparisons to elicit novel measures of how respondents perceive nine dimensions of 100 life-threatening risks. Respondents were well informed about these risks’ relative magnitudes—the correlation between perceived and actual mortality was .82—but those perceptions explained relatively little variation in policy preferences relative to judgments about the status of victims and the appropriate role of government.

Evaluating astrogliosis overcomes this problem because reactive astrocytes highlight the location of toxicant-induced damage. While enhanced expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein is a hallmark of astrogliosis, few other biomarkers have been identified. However, bacterial artificial chromosome - translating ribosome affinity purification (bacTRAP) technology allows for characterization of the actively translating transcriptome of a particular cell type; use of this technology in aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1 (ALDH1L1) bacTRAP mice can identify genes selectively expressed in astrocytes. The aim of this study was to characterize additional biomarkers of neurotoxicity-induced astrogliosis using ALDH1L1 bacTRAP mice. The known dopaminergic neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 12.5 mg/kg s.c.) was used to induce astrogliosis. Striatal tissue was obtained 12, 24, and 48 h following exposure for the isolation of actively translating RNA. Subsequently, MPTP-induced changes in this RNA pool were analyzed by microarray and 184 statistically significant, differentially expressed genes were identified. The dataset was interrogated by gene ontology, pathway, and co-expression network analyses, which identified novel genes, as well as those with known immune and inflammatory functions. Using these analyses, we were directed to several genes associated with reactive astrocytes. Of these, TIMP1 and miR-147 were identified as candidate biomarkers because of their robust increased expression following both MPTP and trimethyl tin exposures. Thus, we have demonstrated that bacTRAP can be used to identify new biomarkers of astrogliosis and aid in the characterization of astrocyte phenotypes induced by toxicant exposures.

We propose that people get this trade-off wrong because they erroneously project their own feelings onto their interaction partners. As a consequence, people overestimate the extent to which recipients of their self-promotion will feel proud of and happy for them, and underestimate the extent to which recipients will feel annoyed (Experiments 1 and 2). Because people tend to promote themselves excessively when trying to make a favorable impression on others, such efforts often backfire, causing targets of self-promotion to view self-promoters as less likeable and as braggarts (Experiment 3).",2015-06-01,2018-03-20T04:53:43Z,2018-03-20T04:53:55Z,2018-03-20T04:53:43Z,903-914,NA,6,26,NA,Psychol Sci,You Call It “Self-Exuberance”; I Call It “Bragging”,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PXV8PJV5\Scopelliti et al. - 2015 - You Call It “Self-Exuberance”; I Call It “Bragging.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001309

A sample of children between the ages of 3 years 6 months and 4 years 11 months took part in the study (N = 103). Results indicated that (a) participants performed better on the sentence-verification than on the multiple-choice task independently of age, (b) each testing method revealed a different hierarchy of constructions, and (c) the impact of testing method on participants’ performance was greater for some constructions than others. Our results suggest that young children can understand complex sentences when they are presented in a manner that better reflects how people process language in natural discourse. These results have implications for the study of language comprehension in suggesting that results from multiple-choice tasks may not generalize to other methods.

Young children know the norm of reciprocity, but it is unclear whether they follow the norm for both positive and negative direct reciprocity or whether reciprocity is initially generalized. Across five experiments (N = 330), we showed that children between 4 and 8 years of age engaged in negative direct reciprocity but generalized positive reciprocity, despite recalling benefactors. Children did not endorse the norm of positive direct reciprocity as applying to them until about 7 years of age (Study 4), but a short social-norm training enhanced this behavior in younger children (Study 5).

We suggest that forgetting occurs because of decay or interference, depending on the memory representation. Recollection-based memories, supported by the hippocampus, are represented in orthogonal patterns and are therefore relatively resistant to interference from one another. Decay should be a major source of their forgetting. By contrast, familiarity-based memories, supported by extrahippocampal structures, are not represented in orthogonal patterns and are therefore sensitive to interference. In a study in which we manipulated the postencoding task-interference level and the length of the delay between study and testing, we provide direct evidence in support of our representation theory of forgetting. Recollection and familiarity were measured using the remember/know procedure. We show that the causes of forgetting depend on the nature of the underlying memory representation, which places the century-old puzzle of forgetting in a coherent framework.",2016-06-01,2018-03-20T01:33:36Z,2018-03-20T01:33:50Z,2018-03-20T01:33:36Z,810-820,NA,6,27,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CX7CSMGR\Sadeh et al. - 2016 - Forgetting Patterns Differentiate Between Two Form.pdf,NA,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001315

While limited self-control is frequently the culprit, another cause is simply forgetting to enact intentions when opportunities arise. We introduce a novel, potent approach to facilitating follow-through: the reminders-through-association approach. This approach involves associating intentions (e.g., to mail a letter on your desk tomorrow) with distinctive cues that will capture attention when you have opportunities to act on those intentions (e.g., Valentine’s Day flowers that arrived late yesterday, which are sitting on your desk). We showed that cue-based reminders are more potent when the cues they employ are distinctive relative to (a) other regularly encountered stimuli and (b) other stimuli encountered concurrently. Further, they can be more effective than written or electronic reminder messages, and they are undervalued and underused.

Methods The study protocol has been published at doi: 10.1007/s11192-016-1964-8. Design Observational cohort study. Population Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted after 1 May 2013. Intervention Mandatory completion of a checklist during manuscript revision. Comparators (1) Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted before May 2013; and (2) similar articles in other journals matched for date and topic. Primary outcome The primary outcome is change in the proportion of Nature articles describing in vivo research published before and after May 2013 reporting the ‘Landis 4’ items (randomisation, blinding, sample size calculation and exclusions). We included 448 Nature Publishing Group (NPG) articles (223 published before May 2013, and 225 after) identified by an individual hired by NPG for this specific task, working to a standard procedure; and an independent investigator used PubMed ‘Related Citations’ to identify 448 non-NPG articles with a similar topic and date of publication from other journals; and then redacted all articles for time-sensitive information and journal name. Redacted articles were assessed by two trained reviewers against a 74-item checklist, with discrepancies resolved by a third. Results 394 NPG and 353 matching non-NPG articles described in vivo research. The number of NPG articles meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria increased from 0/203 prior to May 2013 to 31/181 (16.4%) after (two-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction, Χ²=36.2, df=1, p=1.8×10−9). There was no change in the proportion of non-NPG articles meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria (1/164 before, 1/189 after). There were more substantial improvements in the individual prevalences of reporting of randomisation, blinding, exclusions and sample size calculations for in vivo experiments, and less substantial improvements for in vitro experiments. Conclusion There was an improvement in the reporting of risks of bias in in vivo research in NPG journals following a change in editorial policy, to a level that to our knowledge has not been previously observed.

Ethnic power sharing should therefore reduce the risk of internal conflict. Yet conflict researchers disagree on whether formal power-sharing institutions effectively prevent large-scale violence. We can improve our understanding of the effect of power-sharing institutions by analyzing the mechanisms under which they operate. To this effect, we compare the direct effect of formal power-sharing institutions on peace with their indirect effect through power-sharing behavior. Combining data on inclusive and territorially dispersive institutions with information on power-sharing behavior, we empirically assess this relationship on a global scale. Our causal mediation analysis reveals that formal power-sharing institutions affect the probability of ethnic conflict onset mostly through power-sharing behavior that these institutions induce.",2019,2019-03-20T11:55:33Z,2019-03-20T11:55:44Z,2019-03-20T11:55:33Z,84-100,NA,1,63,NA,NA,Power Sharing,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"©2018, Midwest Political Science Association",NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\E7YTPU7H\Bormann e.a. - 2019 - Power Sharing Institutions, Behavior, and Peace.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RIMEPYZC\ajps.html",NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001319

When governments care about this loss in value, their incentive to tax immobile, publicly traded firms declines.

In pilot studies (pooled N = 794), we identified self-regulatory strategies from self-reports and generated hypotheses about individual differences in trait self-control predicting their use. Next, deploying ambulatory assessment (N = 264, 1940 reports of aversive/challenging activities), we investigated predictors of the strategies' self-reported use and effectiveness (trait self-control and demand types). The popularity of strategies varied across demands. In addition, people higher in trait self-control were more likely to focus on the positive consequences of a given activity, set goals, and use emotion regulation. Focusing on positive consequences, focusing on negative consequences (of not performing the activity), thinking of the near finish, and emotion regulation increased perceived self-regulatory success across demands, whereas distracting oneself from the aversive activity decreased it. None of these strategies, however, accounted for the beneficial effects of trait self-control on perceived self-regulatory success. Hence, trait self-control and strategy use appear to represent separate routes to good self-regulation. By considering trait- and process-approaches these findings promote a more comprehensive understanding of self-regulatory success and failure during people's daily attempts to regulate their persistence. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019-01-01,2019-03-20T17:56:58Z,2019-03-20T17:59:19Z,2019-03-20T17:56:58Z,104-128,NA,1,33,NA,European Journal of Personality,Doing Despite Disliking,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon),NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZGQZFY46\Hennecke e.a. - 2019 - Doing Despite Disliking Self-regulatory Strategie.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\P7KZXARE\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,goal pursuit; persistence; self-control; self-regulation; strategies,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001324

Alternatively, people might be motivated to see their ingroup as more uniquely human (UH) to distance themselves from their corporeal “animal” nature. These explanations were tested in Australia, where social identity is tied less to UH and more to human nature (HN) which does not distinguish humans from animals. Australians attributed more HN traits to the ingroup when mortality was salient, while the attribution of UH traits remained unchanged. This indicates that the mortality-buffering function of ingroup humanization lies in reinforcing the humanness of our social identity, rather than just distancing ourselves from our animal nature. Implications for (de)humanization in intergroup relations are discussed.",2014-11-02,2018-04-05T06:21:25Z,2018-04-05T06:21:39Z,2018-04-05T06:21:25Z,537-545,NA,6,154,NA,NA,Embracing Humanity in the Face of Death,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,NA,PMID: 25280169,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\QS7IA4RD\Vaes et al. - 2014 - Embracing Humanity in the Face of Death Why Do Ex.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\F2DKZGLB\00224545.2014.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2014,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001330

Across three experiments, participants performed a visual search task with either a high or low perceptual load (a well-established attentional manipulation) while exposed to an ambient coffee aroma. Consistent with our hypothesis, results showed that task load modulated olfactory awareness: 42.5% fewer participants in the high- than in the low-load condition reported noticing the coffee aroma. Our final experiment demonstrates that because of unique characteristics of olfactory habituation, the consequences of inattentional anosmia can persist even once attention becomes available.

In these situations, it is essential to form expectations about the others' behaviour to adapt one's own behaviour to increase mutual outcomes and avoid exploitation. Social value orientation, which describes the dispositional weights individuals attach to their own and to another person's outcome, predicts these expectations of cooperation in social dilemmas?an interdependent situation involving a conflict of interests. Yet, scientific evidence is inconclusive about the exact differences in expectations between prosocials, individualists, and competitors. The present meta?analytic results show that, relative to proselfs (individualists and competitors), prosocials expect more cooperation from others in social dilemmas, whereas individualists and competitors do not significantly differ in their expectations. The importance of these expectations in the decision process is further highlighted by the finding that they partially mediate the well?established relation between social value orientation and cooperative behaviour in social dilemmas. In fact, even proselfs are more likely to cooperate when they expect their partner to cooperate.

However, these problems are also prone to errors due to systematic interference (i.e., co-activation of interconnected but incorrect solutions). Semantic control processes are crucial to overcome this type of interference and to retrieve the correct information. Previous research suggests the importance of several brain regions such as the left inferior frontal cortex and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) for semantic control. But, this evidence is mainly based on tasks measuring interference during the processing of lexico-semantic information (e.g., pictures or words). Here, we investigated whether semantic control during arithmetic problem solving (i.e., multiplication fact retrieval) draws upon similar or different brain mechanisms as in other semantic domains (i.e., lexico-semantic). The brain activity of 46 students was measured with fMRI while participants performed an operand-related-lure (OR) and a picture-word (PW) task. In the OR task participants had to verify the correctness of a given solution to a single-digit multiplication. Similarly, in the PW task, participants had to judge whether a presented word matches the concept displayed in a picture or not. Analyses showed that resolving interference in these two tasks modulates the activation of a widespread fronto-parietal network (e.g., left/right IFG, left insula lobe, left IPS). Importantly, conjunction analysis revealed a neural overlap in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars triangularis and left IPS. Additional Bayesian analyses showed that regions that are thought to store lexico-semantic information (e.g., left middle temporal gyrus) did not show evidence for an arithmetic interference effect. Overall, our findings not only indicate that semantic control plays an important role in arithmetic problem solving but also that it is supported by common brain regions across semantic domains. Additionally, by conducting Bayesian analysis we confirmed the hypothesis that the semantic control network contributes differently to semantic tasks of various domains.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:54:40Z,2020-01-30T11:12:25Z,2020-01-30T07:54:40Z,375-393,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,Interference during the retrieval of arithmetic and lexico-semantic knowledge modulates similar brain regions,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A6YLB54I\Heidekum et al. - 2019 - Interference during the retrieval of arithmetic an.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\V3ITY8MA\S0010945219302382.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Intraparietal sulcus; Inferior frontal gyrus; Arithmetic fact; Interference; Semantic control,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001336

This is usually explained by the idea that an initial moral act affirms the moral self-image and hence licenses subsequent immoral acts. Previous meta-analyses on moral licensing indicate significant overall effects of d> .30. However, several large replication studies have either not found the effect or reported a substantially smaller effect size. The present article investigated whether this can be attributed to publication bias. Datasets from two previous meta-analyses on moral licensing were compared and when necessary modified. The larger dataset was used for the present analyses. Using PET-PEESE and a three-parameter-selection-model (3-PSM), we found some evidence for publication bias. The adjusted effect sizes were reduced to d= -0.05, p= .64 and d= 0.18, p= .002, respectively. While the first estimate could be an underestimation, we also found indications that the second estimate might exaggerate the true effect size. It is concluded that both the evidence for and the size of moral licensing effects has likely been inflated by publication bias. Furthermore, our findings indicate that culture moderates the moral licensing effect. Recommendations for future meta-analytic and empirical work are given.

However, there is very limited empirical data on how such a policy might affect the purchasing and consumption of sugary drinks. We report four well-powered, incentive-compatible experiments in which we evaluated two possible ways that restaurants might comply with such a policy: bundling (i.e., dividing the contents of oversized cups into two regulation-size cups) and providing free refills (i.e., offering a regulation-size cup with unlimited refills).

Weak syntax is typically ascribed to limited competence (knowledge) or poor performance (processing). However, with many questioning this dichotomy, alternative explanations should be considered. Arguments related to language exposure are insufficient because language-impaired children often have good input. An alternative account, the learning hypothesis, assumes that individual variation in syntactic abilities reflects variation in construction-learning ability. To evaluate this claim, we tested construction learning in 49 5-year-old English-speaking children, targeting two complex constructions rarely attested in child-directed speech, though with no control of prior exposure. The results revealed that there was substantial variation in the children's construction-learning ability, which was strongly associated with their performance on static standardized language assessments (the Test of Reception of Grammar and the Renfrew Action Picture Task) and that nonadjacent open slots were problematic. While our findings supported the learning hypothesis, further research should determine causes of individual variation in syntactic ability.

During this time-limited reconsolidation window, reactivated existing memories can be strengthened, weakened or updated with new information. Previous studies have shown that non-invasive stimulation of the lateral prefrontal cortex after memory reactivation strengthened existing verbal episodic memories through reconsolidation, an effect documented by enhanced delayed memory recall (24 h post-reactivation). However, it remains unknown whether the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region involved during reactivation of existing episodic memories, contributes to reconsolidation. To address this question, in this double-blind experiment healthy participants (n = 27) received transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with the anode over the left PPC after reactivation of previously learned verbal episodic memories. Memory recall was tested 24 h later. To rule out unspecific effects of memory reactivation or tDCS alone, we included two control groups: one that receives tDCS with the anode over the left PPC without reactivation (n = 27) and another one that receives tDCS with the anode over a control site (primary visual cortex) after reactivation (n = 27). We hypothesized that tDCS with the anode over the left PPC after memory reactivation would enhance delayed recall through reconsolidation relative to the two control groups. No significant between groups differences in the mean number of words recalled on day 3 occurred, suggesting no beneficial effect of tDCS over the left PPC.

This means that long-term memory shares processing resources with the sensorimotor system. The main objective of this work is to provide new evidence in favour of two claims from the embodied cognition framework: (1) memory is grounded on the sensorimotor system, that is, memory shares processing resources with the sensorimotor system, and (2) memory serves at least in part to support action. For this purpose, the present experiment aimed to show that the action context modulates the motor simulation and, consequently, the memory of manipulable objects. Participants were presented with short phrases comprising the name of a manipulable object, and an action verb (“To take a cup”) or an attentional verb (“To see a cup”). During this phase, they had to put their hands in front of them in the control condition, whereas they had to keep them behind their back in the interfering condition. A cued recall test followed after a short distractive letter-matching task, with the verbs serving as cues. Results showed that memory of the words denoting manipulable objects was impaired by the interfering posture when associated with an action verb, but not when associated with an attentional verb. This suggests that a context which does not favour action interferes with motor simulation and thus decreases the memory of manipulable objects. These results provide strong evidence for a grounded account of memory and language.",2019-05-01,2020-02-05T06:02:23Z,2020-02-05T06:02:59Z,2020-02-05T06:02:23Z,1112-1118,NA,5,72,NA,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XDS6HDAP\Dutriaux et al. - 2019 - How to change your memory of an object with a post.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,language; action; Grounded cognition; long-term memory; mental model,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001341

This is the traditional account of the attentional blink, whereby observers fail to report the second of two temporally proximal targets. Recent analyses have challenged this simple account, suggesting that attentional selection during the attentional blink is not only (a) suppressed, but also (b) temporally advanced then delayed, and (c) temporally diffused. Here, we reanalyzed six data sets using mixture modeling of report errors, and revealed much simpler dynamics. Exposing a problem inherent in previous analyses, we found evidence of a second attentional episode only when the second target (T2) follows the first (T1) by more than 100 to 250 ms. When a second episode occurs, suppression and delay reduce steadily as lag increases and temporal precision is stable. At shorter lags, both targets are reported from a single episode, which explains why T2 can escape the attentional blink when it immediately follows T1 (Lag-1 sparing).",2016-08-01,2018-03-20T01:11:10Z,2018-03-20T01:11:24Z,2018-03-20T01:11:10Z,1146-1156,NA,8,27,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\R2LJYYS2\Goodbourn et al. - 2016 - Reconsidering Temporal Selection in the Attentiona.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001350

What accounts for the prevalence of these judgments, given that their validity is at best uncertain? We hypothesized that the tendency to reason from “is” to “ought” is due in part to a systematic bias in people’s (nonmoral) explanations, whereby regularities (e.g., giving roses on Valentine’s Day) are explained predominantly via inherent or intrinsic facts (e.g., roses are beautiful). In turn, these inherence-biased explanations lead to value-laden downstream conclusions (e.g., it is good to give roses). Consistent with this proposal, results from five studies (N = 629 children and adults) suggested that, from an early age, the bias toward inherence in explanations fosters inferences that imbue observed reality with value. Given that explanations fundamentally determine how people understand the world, the bias toward inherence in these judgments is likely to exert substantial influence over sociomoral understanding.",2016-08-01,2018-03-20T01:10:18Z,2018-03-20T01:10:31Z,2018-03-20T01:10:17Z,1109-1122,NA,8,27,NA,Psychol Sci,Why Do People Tend to Infer “Ought” From “Is”?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\XY6VI6IC\Tworek and Cimpian - 2016 - Why Do People Tend to Infer “Ought” From “Is” The.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001351

We fitted the linear ballistic accumulator to data from a perceptual-judgment task to examine the impacts of reward- and punishment-based incentives on three distinct components of information processing: the quality of the information processed, the quantity of that information, and the decision threshold. The threat of punishment lowered the average quality and quantity of information processed, compared with the prospect of reward or no performance incentive at all. The threat of punishment also induced less cautious decision making by lowering people’s decision thresholds relative to the prospect of reward.

Although intellectual humility describes an intrapersonal style of processing information, we theorize that it also has interpersonal roots. This article describes four experiments and one daily-diary study examining the impact of perceived partner responsiveness and unresponsiveness on two manifestations of intellectual humility, lesser self-serving bias and openness to novel information that may contradicting existing beliefs. Studies 1–3 indicated that three well-established examples of self-serving bias—the tendency to rate oneself as better than an average peer, overclaiming personal responsibility for shared household activities, and hindsight bias—were strengthened when people were induced to perceive their partners as unresponsive, but weakened when they were led to perceive their partners as responsive. Study 4, a daily-diary study, demonstrated similar effects of everyday perceptions of responsiveness on hindsight bias, and also found that people reported having been more open to considering alternative, potentially conflicting points of view when they felt that their social environment was responsive to them. Finally, Study 5 found that perceived partner responsiveness led people to adopt a broader perspective. Together, these studies point to perceptions of responsiveness and unresponsiveness as one factor that lessens and intensifies, respectively, openness and non-defensiveness.",2018-11-01,2019-03-30T16:52:04Z,2019-03-30T16:52:13Z,2019-03-30T16:52:04Z,21-33,NA,NA,79,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PRMGLUKR\Reis e.a. - 2018 - Perceived partner responsiveness promotes intellec.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3LVVQBYE\S002210311830009X.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001353

However, there has been little work to identify different cognitive processes that may be underpinning these delayed memory deficits for mTBI. Frontal cortex is important for delayed memory, and is implicated in the pathophysiology of mTBI; moreover, frontal lobes are typically considered the locus of executive abilities. To further explore these relationships, we sought to partly explain delayed memory deficits after mTBI by examining behavioral indicators of executive function. Results showed that sub-acute as well as chronic mTBI patients performed worse than controls on the delayed memory trial of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (Brandt & Benedict, 2001), recalling approximately 18% and 15% fewer words, respectively. Furthermore, worse delayed memory performance was associated with less use of the cognitive strategy of semantic clustering, and with lower scores for the executive function composite from a standardized neuropsychological battery (NIH EXAMINER; Kramer et al., 2014). In contrast, serial clustering, a memory organizational strategy thought to be less dependent on executive function, did not show strong relationships to clinical status or delayed memory performance. This exploratory work suggests novel hypotheses to be tested in future, confirmatory studies, including that general executive functions and/or semantic clustering will mediate delayed memory deficits following mTBI.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:53:00Z,2020-01-30T11:10:45Z,2020-01-30T07:53:00Z,240-248,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LIMP3WGV\Broadway et al. - 2019 - Executive function predictors of delayed memory de.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\S8CZEJDJ\S0010945219302424.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Concussion; Delayed free recall; Delayed memory; Executive function; Mild traumatic brain injury; Semantic clustering,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001355

Building on research showing that déjà vu can be driven by an unrecalled memory of a past experience that relates to the current situation, we sought evidence of memory-based predictive ability during déjà vu states. Déjà vu did not lead to above-chance ability to predict the next turn in a navigational path resembling a previously experienced but unrecalled path (although such resemblance increased reports of déjà vu). However, déjà vu states were accompanied by increased feelings of knowing the direction of the next turn. The results suggest that feelings of premonition during déjà vu occur and can be illusory.

Therefore, people are more sensitive to novelty detection but likely lose flexibility in subsequent novelty processing after detection. To demonstrate the dynamic changes in neural adaption in repeated problem-solving behaviors and test its negative influence on subsequent nonrepetitive problem-solving behaviors, we adopted a Chinese character decomposition task in this fMRI study. Participants were asked to repeatedly perform 3–5 practice problems that could be solved by the same loose chunk decomposition (LCD) solution followed by a test problem that could be solved by a tight chunk decomposition (TCD) solution in the enhanced-set condition. The practice problem gradually elicited lower percent signal changes within the cuneus, superior parietal lobule (SPL), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in serial positions −1, −2 and −3 of a set, implying that neural adaptation occurred in repeated practice. Both the test problem and the practice problem that following it recruited greater activation of the SPL and IFG in the enhanced-set condition than in the base-set condition when the practice problem and test problem alternately appeared, implying that the task switching cost from a more dominant task to a less dominant task and vice versa was increased after neural adaptation occurred. In other words, repeatedly solving a set of similar problems with the same solution likely leads to neural adaptation and cognitive inflexibility, which in turn have an undifferentiated impact on task switching. This finding expands existing knowledge about the neurocognitive mechanism underlying the formation of the mental set and sheds light on the influence of neural adaptation on subsequent processing.",2019-10-01,2020-01-30T07:35:59Z,2020-01-30T07:40:11Z,2020-01-30T07:35:59Z,470-479,NA,NA,119,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\UYDM88G2\Huang et al. - 2019 - Neural adaptation and cognitive inflexibility in r.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WYV8WEDL\S0010945219302874.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Chunk decomposition; Cognitive inflexibility; Mental set; Neural adaptation; Task switching,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001361

We examined this possibility using data from two independent longitudinal studies of 204 newlywed couples and used actor–partner interdependence growth-curve modeling. Results demonstrated that relatively unrestricted (vs. restricted) sociosexuality was associated with an increased probability of relationship dissolution through declines in marital satisfaction over time. Additional exploratory analyses provided preliminary evidence suggesting that frequent sex, high sexual satisfaction, and low stress weaken this association.

Adopting this model (Framework for L2 Pronunciation Measurement) as a synthetic tool, we coded the instruments found in 77 studies of L2 pronunciation teaching published between 1982 and 2017. We calculated the frequency of each measurement type and reexamined the interaction of instructional effectiveness and measurement within the sample. According to the results, instruction is most effective when it targets learners’ monitored production of specific segmental or suprasegmental features.

The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is an important nucleus participating in motor control under both physiological and pathological conditions. Morphological studies reveal that orexinergic neurons located in lateral hypothalamus innervate the SNc. Both orexin-1 receptors (OX1R) and orexin-2 receptors (OX2R) are expressed in the SNc. To investigate the effects of orexins on SNc, single unit in vivo extracellular recordings and behavioral tests were performed in this study. Micro-pressure administration of orexin A and orexin B significantly increased the spontaneous firing rate of nigral DAergic neurons by 65.87 ± 7.73% and 90.49 ± 17.83%, respectively. The excitatory effects of orexin A on nigral DAergic neurons were mainly mediated by OX1R, while OX2R were involved in the increase in firing rate induced by orexin B. Selectively blocking OX1R and OX2R significantly decreased the firing rate of nigral DAergic neurons by 36.77 ± 6.26% and 32.04 ± 6.12%, respectively, which suggested that endogenous orexins modulated the spontaneous firing activity of nigral DAergic neurons. Finally, both elevated body swing test and haloperidol-induced postural behavioral test showed that unilateral microinjection of orexin A and orexin B induced significantly contralateral-biased swing and deflection behavior. Meanwhile, the specific OX1R and OX2R antagonists produced opposite effects. The present electrophysiological and behavioral studies suggested that orexins increased the firing activity of nigral DAergic neurons and participated in central motor control.

Here, we investigated regulatory mechanisms for acetylcholine (ACh) release from cholinergic neurons by performing superfusion experiments with rat striatal segments after labelling the cellular ACh pool with [3H]choline. Electrical stimulation-evoked pronounced [3H]ACh release from cholinergic neurons. The estimated quantity of [3H]ACh release per pulse of electrical stimulation was reduced by an increase in stimulus frequency, showing an inverse correlation between release probability of ACh and neuronal excitation. ACh release was also negatively regulated by pre-synaptic muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs). The autoinhibition induced by released ACh was predominantly suppressed by the M2-selective antagonist AF-DX 116, partially inhibited by M3-selective darifenacin, and minimally by M4-selective PD 102807. Other subtype-selective antagonists had no effect at subtype-selective concentrations. ACh esterase (AChE) inhibitors (diisopropylfluorophosphate, donepezil and galantamine) at concentrations that mostly inhibit esterase activity reduced [3H]ACh release, and the reduction was abolished by treatment with atropine. This implies that pre-synaptic autoreceptors are activated more after blockade of ACh hydrolysis, leading to autoinhibition of ACh release and consequent reduction in synaptic ACh concentrations. [3H]efflux was also enhanced by ACh uptake inhibitors (100 μM hemicholinium-3 and physostigmine), regardless of ACh hydrolysis. This study shows that synaptic ACh concentrations in striatal cholinergic neurons are regulated in a complex manner by many factors such as release probability, pre-synaptic M2/M3/M4 mAChRs, AChE and post-synaptic ACh uptake, and provides important information about cholinergic neurotransmission for future exploration of therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's and other central nervous system diseases.

The initiators of inflammatory pathways in the CNS are microglia activated in response to acute ischemic stress, and anti-depressants have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in the CNS, promoting neuronal survival following ischemic insult. We have previously shown that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and citalopram promote neuronal survival after oxygen-glucose deprivation, an in vitro model of ischemia, by attenuating the release of glutamate and D-serine from activated microglia. Interestingly, we found that fluoxetine-treated microglial cultures contained fewer numbers of cells compared to other groups and hypothesized that fluoxetine and citalopram attenuated the release of glutamate and D-serine by promoting the apoptosis of microglia. The present study aimed to test and compare antidepressants from three distinct classes (tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and SSRIs) on microglial apoptosis. Primary microglia were treated with 1 ?g/mL lipopolysaccharide and/or 10 ?M antidepressants, and various apoptotic markers were assayed. Fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine decreased protein levels in cell lysates, decreased cell viability of microglia, and increased the expression of the apoptotic marker cleaved-caspase 3 in microglia. Live/dead nuclear staining also showed that fluoxetine- or norfluoxetine-treated cultures contained greater numbers of dying microglial cells compared to vehicle-treated cultures. Cultures treated with citalopram, phenelzine, or imipramine showed no evidence of inducing microglial apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that fluoxetine and norfluoxetine induce the apoptotic death of microglia, which may serve as a mechanism to attenuate the release of glutamate and D-serine from activated microglia.

This lack of usage may stem from fears of distorting treatment effects and uncertainty regarding which type to use (e.g., instructional manipulation checks [IMCs] or assessments of whether stimuli alter a latent independent variable of interest). Here, we first categorize the main variants and argue that factual manipulation checks (FMCs)—that is, objective questions about key elements of the experiment—can identify individual-level attentiveness to experimental information and, as a consequence, better enable researchers to diagnose experimental findings. We then find, through four replication studies, little evidence that FMC placement affects treatment effects, and that placing FMCs immediately post-outcome does not attenuate FMC passage rates. Additionally, FMC and IMC passage rates are only weakly related, suggesting that each technique identifies different sets of attentive subjects. Thus, unlike other methods, FMCs can confirm attentiveness to experimental protocols.",2019,2019-03-20T12:02:00Z,2019-03-20T12:02:14Z,2019-03-20T12:02:00Z,234-249,NA,1,63,NA,NA,No Harm in Checking,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"©2018, Midwest Political Science Association",NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3NXDMEFI\Kane en Barabas - 2019 - No Harm in Checking Using Factual Manipulation Ch.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\NPVUVVIW\ajps.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001369

Clinical applications with encouraging results have been reported in several pilot studies, but the optimal stimulation protocols remain to be determined. This is also important because the efficacy and directionality of tDCS effects follow non-linear rules regarding neuroplastic effects for the stimulation parameters duration and intensity. In this study, we systemically explored the association between tDCS, these parameters and induced after-effects on motor cortex excitability. Cathodal tDCS was applied in four different intensities (sham, 1, 2 and 3 mA) and three durations (15, 20 and 30 mins) in 16 young healthy subjects and the after-effects were monitored with TMS-induced motor evoked potentials (MEP) until the next day evening after stimulation. The results of the repeated measures ANOVA conducted to disentangle the effects of tDCS intensity and duration show a main effect of intensity in which 1 mA and 3 mA stimulation induced a reduction of MEP amplitudes, but 2 mA resulted in excitability enhancement. The results of a secondary ANOVA conducted to compare if active stimulation effects differ from those of sham stimulation revealed a significant main effect of tDCS condition in which 1 mA–15 min, 1 mA–30 min and 3 mA–20 min cathodal tDCS induced LTD-like plasticity, while LTP-like plasticity was observed after 2 mA–20 min stimulation.

To address this limitation, four studies examined common outlier-treatments in terms of (1) the overall size of evaluative priming effects, (2) their internal consistency, and (3) their relation to corresponding explicit measures in the domains of conditioned attitudes (Study 1), political attitudes (Study 2), racial attitudes (Study 3), and ethnic attitudes (Study 4).

Accordingly, sensorimotor and visual processes should provide congruent emotional information about a facial expression. Here, we report evidence that challenges this view. Specifically, the repeated execution of facial expressions has the opposite effect on the recognition of a subsequent facial expression than the repeated viewing of facial expressions. Moreover, the findings of the motor condition, but not of the visual condition, were correlated with a nonsensory condition in which participants imagined an emotional situation.

Often this comes independently of (or as a counterforce to) official responses by the political leadership. Research has not yet clarified the effect of such public expressions of remorse on intergroup forgiveness, nor has it explicated their role in a collective apology. We propose that grassroots gestures of remorse by collectives of the offender group may enhance intergroup forgiveness among victim group members because they exert a particularly powerful influence on perceptions of prototypical group sentiment. Four experiments (Ns = 434, 204, 600, 278) varied information about the provision of a leader apology and the grassroots public response to an intergroup transgression. Results show that grassroots responses can enhance victim group perceptions of offender group remorse, as well as subsequent feelings of forgiveness toward the offender group. In contrast, leader apologies generally failed to increase perceived remorse or promote intergroup forgiveness. Patterns were largely consistent across varying forms of grassroots responses (i.e., sorry demonstrations, letter-writing, social media buzz, public opinion polls), diverse transgression contexts (i.e., racial violence, carnage during combat, symbolic insult, ethnic conflict), and among different national groups.

We addressed this question by investigating whether 12-month-olds used preverbal categories to discover the meanings of new words. We showed that one group of infants (n = 18) readily extended novel labels to previously unseen exemplars of preverbal visual categories after only a single labeling episode, but two other groups struggled to do so when taught labels for unfamiliar categories (those who had been previously exposed, n = 18, or not exposed, n = 18, to category tokens). These results suggest that infants expect labels to denote categories of objects and are equipped with learning mechanisms responsible for matching prelinguistic knowledge structures with linguistic inputs. This ability is consistent with the idea that our conceptual machinery provides building blocks for vocabulary and language acquisition.",2019-02,2019-04-06T18:53:07Z,2019-04-06T18:53:14Z,2019-04-06T18:53:07Z,288-299,NA,2,30,NA,NA,Lexical Acquisition Through Category Matching,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7I9BY27T\Pomiechowska en Gliga - 2019 - Lexical Acquisition Through Category Matching 12-.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001374

Our aim was to investigate the presence of subtle motor deficits in this population and its relationship with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β levels. We adapted the Finger Tapping Task to measure tapping speed and intrasubject variability. Seventy-two right-handed participants completed the study. Subjects were divided into three groups according to their CSF biomarker profile: 37 control participants (negative CSF AD biomarkers, CTR), 20 cognitively normal subjects with amyloid-β positivity (abnormal levels of CSF Aβ42, Aβ+) and 15 AD patients. All subjects underwent lumbar puncture for the CSF analysis, apolipoprotein E genotyping and completed the Finger Tapping Task, a neuropsychological battery and cardiovascular risk factor and physical activity assessments. An overall difference between groups was found both in tapping speed [F(2,66) = 19.37, p < .01] and in intrasubject variability [F(2,66) = 11.40, p < .01]. More specifically, the Aβ+ group showed lower speed [F(1,52) = 5.33, p < .05] and greater intrasubject variability [F(1,52) = 8.48, p < .01] than the CTR group, and higher speed than the AD group [F(1,30) = 13.61, p < .01]. Speed (β = .263, p < .05) and intrasubject variability (β = −.558, p < .01) were significantly associated with CSF amyloid-β levels. The present findings suggest that subtle motor difficulties can be detected in cognitively healthy subjects with amyloid-β positivity and be related to CSF Aβ42 levels.

We examined the impact of counterattitudinal information on implicit evaluations in two experiments (N = 60, N = 72) that included an innovative manipulation: hypnotic suggestions to participants that they would strongly process upcoming counterattitudinal information.

Results from mixed-effects linear models showed that although direct corrections and codes were effective for enhancing learners’ immediate grammatical and nongrammatical accuracy (i.e., during text revision), a long-term advantage (i.e., 4 weeks after feedback provision) was only evident for direct corrections.

This discrepancy did not emerge if the other was emotionally distant (e.g., an acquaintance), suggesting that the self-other discrepancy in anxiety is moderated by the quality of the relationship. Neither a perceived higher personal control, nor a perceived lower probability of encountering negative events, as suggested by research on self-other biases in risk assessment, accounted for the effect.

The present study, informed by the pathogen-prevalence hypothesis, tested the influence of individualism and collectivism on xenophobic response to the threat of Ebola. A nationally representative sample of 1,000 Americans completed a survey, indicating their perceptions of their vulnerability to Ebola, ability to protect themselves from Ebola (protection efficacy), and xenophobic tendencies. Overall, the more vulnerable people felt, the more they exhibited xenophobic responses, but this relationship was moderated by individualism and collectivism. The increase in xenophobia associated with increased vulnerability was especially pronounced among people with high individualism scores and those with low collectivism scores.

The present study investigates adults’ success and strategy use in interpreting covariation data as a function of two factors that may influence performance: symmetry and context. We hypothesised that symmetrical problems, which involve comparing two candidate causes, would elicit more adequate interpretations than asymmetrical problems, which involve comparing the presence and absence of one candidate cause. We also hypothesised that problems with grounded, concrete contexts would elicit more adequate interpretations than abstract problems. College students (N = 109) interpreted contingency tables in four conditions that varied in symmetry and context. Both factors influenced correct interpretations. A latent class analysis revealed three distinct strategies: (a) compute conditional probabilities (40%), (b) compare-two cells (23%), and (c) anchor and compare (37%), a novel strategy in which reasoners integrate data from all four cells in a stimulus-driven but incorrect way. Participants’ use of the conditional-probabilities strategy was higher in the symmetrical than the asymmetrical conditions, and higher in the concrete than the abstract conditions.

Further, the negative effects of incentives hold only when the incentives imply a selfish motive; advocates who are offered a matching incentive (i.e., who are told that the donations they successfully solicit will be matched), which is not incompatible with altruism, perform just as well as those who are not incentivized.

Participants (total N = 72) were presented with colored real-life objects and were asked to recall the colors using a continuous color wheel. Deviations from study colors were modeled to generate two estimates of color memory: the variability of remembered colors—fidelity—and the probability of forgetting the color. Estimating model parameters using both maximum-likelihood estimation and Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we found that working memory had better fidelity than long-term memory (Experiments 1 and 2). Furthermore, within each system, fidelity worsened as a function of time-correlated mechanisms (Experiments 2 and 3). We conclude that fidelity is subject to decline across and within memory systems.

This manuscript reports direct replications of three key experiments reported by Ottati et al. 2015 in this journal in support of the Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis. Consistent with the original findings, it was found that dogmatic behavior is considered substantially more appropriate for experts relative to novices (d=0.45 [0.35, 0.55] over all replications and original study). In addition, it was confirmed that when participants envision themselves as experts they predict they will be more close-minded (d=−0.54 [−0.64, −0.44]). Unfortunately, replications involving manipulation of expertise through task difficulty showed little to no effect on open-minded cognition (d=0.00 [−0.21, 0.21] for easy/difficult recall task; d=−0.02 [−0.21, 0.17] for easy/difficult trivia task). The balance of evidence suggests that the Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis is currently well-supported only for prospective manipulations of expertise that require participants to predict their social behaviors.

We test the hypothesis that a listener’s discrimination of and sensitivity (d’) to Japanese pitch accent reflects how pitch cues inform all words a listener knows in an additive, nonselective manner rather than how pitch cues inform words in a selective, Japanese-only manner. Six groups of listeners performed a speeded ABX discrimination task in Japanese.

Interestingly, there is evidence that the way in which the volume of an object is experienced can affect the strength of the illusion, with a SWI induced by exclusively haptic volume cues feeling stronger than a SWI induced with only visual volume cues. Furthermore, visual cues appear to add nothing over and above haptic size cues in terms of the strength of the induced weight illusion–findings which are difficult to reconcile with work using cue-conflict paradigms where visual cues usually dominate haptic cues. Here, virtual reality was used to place these senses in conflict with one another. Participants (N = 22) judged the heaviness of identically weighted cylinders across three conditions: (1) objects appeared different sizes but were physically the same size, (2) objects were physically different sizes but appeared to be the same size, or (3) objects which looked and felt different sizes from one another. Consistent with prior work, haptic size cues induced a larger SWI than that induced by visual size differences. In contrast to prior work, however, congruent vision and haptic size cues yielded a larger still SWI. These findings not only add to our understanding of how different modalities combine to influence our hedonic perception but also showcase how virtual reality can develop novel cue-conflict paradigms.",2019-09-01,2020-02-05T06:17:58Z,2020-02-05T06:18:12Z,2020-02-05T06:17:58Z,2168-2175,NA,9,72,NA,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3PR9LT3K\Buckingham - 2019 - Examining the size–weight illusion with visuo-hapt.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Virtual reality; heaviness perception; illusions,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001397

While their actions are sometimes deemed morally courageous, existing evidence that whistleblowers are primarily motivated by moral concerns is mixed. Moreover, little is known about the extent to which moral concerns predict whistleblowing relative to other organizational and situational factors. To address these gaps, we present two studies demonstrating the power of moral concerns in predicting whistleblowing decisions. Study 1 uses a large cross-sectional dataset of federal employees (N = 42,020) to test how moral concerns predict real-world whistleblowing decisions relative to other factors. Study 2 provides a more controlled replication of the association between moral concerns and whistleblowing decisions in an online sample of the U.S. workforce. Results revealed that moral concerns consistently predicted whistleblowing decisions above and beyond other organizational and situational factors. Specifically, whistleblowing decisions were associated with a tradeoff between moral concerns; whereby, concerns for the fair treatment of others beyond one's organization were associated with reporting unethical behavior, while loyalty to one's organization was associated with not reporting unethical behavior. Organizational factors, such as whether the organization educates its employees about how to disclose wrongdoing, showed a somewhat weaker association with whistleblowing decisions across studies. However, they were the only significant predictors of how people blew the whistle; that is, reporting unethical behavior through internal versus external channels. Together, these findings reveal important psychological motivations underlying whistleblowing, highlighting the power of moral concerns in these decisions and supporting conceptualizations of whistleblowing as an important example of moral courage.",2019-11-01,2020-02-06T02:03:12Z,2020-02-07T00:41:57Z,2020-02-06T02:03:12Z,103848,NA,NA,85,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J9H3EYA9\Dungan et al. - 2019 - The power of moral concerns in predicting whistleb.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3KPHL6WN\S0022103118306619.html,NA,OSBadgePreregistered,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Fairness; Loyalty; Moral courage; Organizational citizenship behavior; Whistleblowing,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001399

Correction of this imbalance, with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibiting agents, could be neuroprotective. We therefore hypothesize that nicotinamide, being a selective inhibitor of HDAC class III as well as having modulatory effects on mitochondrial energy metabolism, would be neuroprotective in the lactacystin rat model of PD, which recapitulates the formation of neurotoxic accumulation of altered proteins within the substantia nigra to cause progressive dopaminergic cell death. Rats received nicotinamide for 28 days, starting 7 days after unilateral injection of the irreversible proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, into the substantia nigra. Longitudinal motor behavioural testing and structural magnetic resonance imaging were used to track changes in this model of PD, and assessment of nigrostriatal integrity, histone acetylation and brain gene expression changes post-mortem used to quantify nicotinamide-induced neuroprotection. Counterintuitively, nicotinamide dose-dependently exacerbated neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons, behavioural deficits and structural brain changes in the lactacystin-lesioned rat. Nicotinamide treatment induced histone hyperacetylation and over-expression of numerous neurotrophic and anti-apoptotic factors in the brain, yet failed to result in neuroprotection, rather exacerbated dopaminergic pathology. These findings highlight the importance of inhibitor specificity within HDAC isoforms for therapeutic efficacy in PD, demonstrating the contrasting effects of HDAC class III inhibition upon cell survival in this animal model of the disease.

Four studies (and an internal meta-analysis) tested the idea that receiving a generous gift from someone higher in perceived socioeconomic status (SES) signals social identity threat. In Study 1 (N = 218), participants on average, but especially those with relatively lower SES, reported experiencing more self-conscious negative affect when receiving a generous amount of money (vs. an even split) from a higher status giver in a dictator game. This effect was mediated by feeling pitied by the giver. Studies 2 (N = 331) and 3 (N = 426) revealed similar effects with recalled real-world experiences of receiving a generous gift from higher SES givers. Studies 3 and 4 (N = 142) revealed evidence for serial mediation, with lower relative SES predicting status awareness, status awareness predicting attributions of pity, and attributions of pity in turn predicting self-conscious negative affect. Effects were not significantly moderated by needing or requesting the money, suggesting that acts of generosity across the status divide readily signal social devaluation for those with lower perceived status.

Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), a key enzyme for S1P production, is concentrated in presynaptic terminals. However, the role of S1P/SphK1 signaling in exocytosis remains elusive. By detecting catecholamine release from single vesicles in chromaffin cells, we show that a dominant negative SphK1 (SphK1DN) reduces the number of amperometric spikes and increases the duration of foot, which reflects release through a fusion pore, implying critical roles for S1P in regulating the rate of exocytosis and fusion pore expansion. Similar phenotypes were observed in chromaffin cells obtained from SphK1 knockout mice compared to those from wild-type mice. In addition, extracellular S1P treatment increased the number of amperometric spikes, and this increase, in turn, was inhibited by a selective S1P3 receptor blocker, suggesting extracellular S1P may regulate the rate of exocytosis via activation of S1P3. Furthermore, intracellular S1P application induced a decrease in foot duration of amperometric spikes in control cells, indicating intracellular S1P may regulate fusion pore expansion during exocytosis. Taken together, our study represents the first demonstration that S1P regulates exocytosis through distinct mechanisms: extracellular S1P may modulate the rate of exocytosis via activation of S1P receptors while intracellular S1P may directly control fusion pore expansion during exocytosis.

However, interpretation can be tricky given that different choices for centering model predictors can lead to different versions of what appear to be the same parameters; this is especially the case when the predictors are latent variables created through model-estimated variance components. A further complication is a recent change to Mplus (Version 8.1), a popular software program for estimating multivariate multilevel models, in which the selection of Bayesian estimation instead of maximum likelihood results in different lower-level predictors when random slopes are requested. This article provides a detailed explication of how the parameters of multilevel models differ as a function of the analyst’s decisions regarding centering and the form of lower-level predictors (i.e., observed or latent), the method of estimation, and the variant of program syntax used. After explaining how different methods of centering lower-level observed predictor variables result in different higher-level effects within univariate multilevel models, this article uses simulated data to demonstrate how these same concepts apply in specifying multivariate multilevel models with latent lower-level predictor variables.

However, many studies demonstrating belief perseverance have presented participants with mixed evidence. The present research investigated whether people maintain their beliefs in response to a single pattern of findings. Across four studies, participants consistently shifted their beliefs in response to the evidence, even when it challenged their views on religion (Studies 1–3), politics (Study 3), gun control (Study 3), and capital punishment (Studies 3–4). Participants were also receptive to mixed evidence, shifting their beliefs in response to the first study presented and shifting back in response to the second (and overall, depolarizing in response to the evidence). Participants not only updated their beliefs about the research question but also sometimes their position on the issue. In some cases, bias emerged in participants' evaluations of evidence, but not in others. Evaluations of evidence quality generally predicted belief change in response to the evidence and did not largely explain the degree of belief maintenance participants exhibited. These findings suggest that people may be receptive to counter-attitudinal evidence when the findings are clear, and highlight the importance of further examining the conditions under which biased assimilation and belief perseverance (vs. change) occur.",2019-05-01,2020-02-04T03:39:47Z,2020-02-04T03:40:07Z,2020-02-04T03:39:47Z,176-199,NA,NA,82,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Do beliefs yield to evidence?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\AR3Y9ZIJ\Anglin - 2019 - Do beliefs yield to evidence Examining belief per.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YB28LZ82\S0022103118304529.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Motivated reasoning; Attitude polarization; Belief perseverance; Belief updating; Biased assimilation; Confirmation bias,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001406

Because research has only considered how integral arousal (i.e., arousal from within the auction) affects bidding, the current research considered whether incidental arousal (i.e., arousal from outside the auction) also increases bidding. With two different manipulations of arousal, Experiments 1 and 2 showed that incidental arousal increased bidding in live auctions with monetary stakes. Experiment 1 also measured arousal physiologically to demonstrate its role in bidding. Experiment 3 utilized a third manipulation of incidental arousal and found that individuals were unaware of its effects. Overall, the current research demonstrates how bidders are potentially subject to many different sources of arousal that have nothing to do with auctions, all of which can unwittingly increase individuals' bidding.",2019-01-01,2019-03-30T17:12:26Z,2019-03-30T17:12:36Z,2019-03-30T17:12:26Z,52-58,NA,NA,80,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Auction fever,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\Y6YNQDBD\Adam e.a. - 2019 - Auction fever The unrecognized effects of inciden.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\F7239H3B\S0022103117303505.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Arousal; Auctions; Economic exchange; Heart rate,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001407

Here we show that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of early diffusion-weighted lesion maps can be used to accurately predict long-term recovery of tactile object recognition (TOR) in 35 subjects with varying hand skill impairment and associated specific daily activity limitation after cortical sensori-motor stroke. Multiple regression analysis revealed the essentially dysfunctional subprocesses for object recognition in the specifically impaired subjects, i.e., grasping as determined by a subtest of Jebsen Taylor hand function test, and perception of macrogeometrical object properties. The Gaussian process regression of MVPA represents a function that relates a selection of lesioned voxels as input variables to TOR performance scores as target variables. On the behavioural level, patients fell into three recovery subgroups, depending on TOR performance over the observation period. Only baseline motor hand skill and shape discrimination were significantly correlated with the TOR trajectories. To define functionally meaningful voxels, we combined information from MVPA of lesion maps and a priori knowledge of regions of interest derived from a data bank for shape recognition. A high significance for the predicted TOR performances over nine months could be verified by permutation tests, leading us to expect that the model generalises to larger patient cohorts with first cortical ischemic stroke. The lesion sites of the persistently impaired subjects exhibited an overlap with critical areas related to the MVPA prediction map in the cytoarchitectonic areas PFt of inferior parietal lobule and OP1 of parietal operculum which are associated with higher order sensory processing. This ultimate check corroborated the significance of the MVPA map for the prediction of tactile object recognition. The clinical implication of our study is that neuroimaging data acquired immediately after first stroke could facilitate individual forecasting of post-stroke recovery.",2019-06-01,2020-01-30T07:01:49Z,2020-01-30T07:02:09Z,2020-01-30T07:01:49Z,264-279,NA,NA,115,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2VEYA5U9\Abela et al. - 2019 - Early prediction of long-term tactile object recog.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\4CIUIZ78\S0010945219300383.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cortical sensorimotor stroke; Multi-voxel pattern analysis; Neuronal network for shape recognition; Prediction; Tactile object recognition (TOR),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001408

To supplement previously published datasets, we report two novel experiments: Experiment 1 (n = 12) found null effects of adaptation to 10° leftward prisms on spatial bias in the landmark task, and Experiment 2 (n = 24) found null effects of 12° leftward prisms on spatial bias in a computerised line bisection task. Including these data, we considered 17 experiments for the landmark task (total n = 256), and 12 experiments for line bisection (total n = 172), in which participants were adapted for between 7 and 20 min to prism strengths from 8 to 17°. A random-effects meta-analysis, with prism strength and exposure duration as moderators, confirmed robust rightward shifts in visuospatial judgements following leftward prism adaptation. The average standardised effect sizes (Cohen's d) were similar between tasks, increasing by around .1 per degree of prismatic displacement, and being boosted by a long (10 min +) period of prism exposure. However, the quality of evidence and precision of prediction was superior for the landmark task, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio within studies, and less heterogeneity between studies. We suggest that line bisection responses may be contaminated by sensorimotor aftereffects, and that the landmark task is a more suitable method for measuring true visuospatial aftereffects of prism adaptation. To harness these effects, we recommend that researchers should expose participants to 15° (or higher) leftward prisms for more than ten minutes, with upwards of 250 pointing movements. Power calculations should take account of heterogeneity in the true effect size between studies; and further investigation of the factors underlying this heterogeneity will help to refine optimally-effective methods.",2019-02-01,2019-03-29T09:24:22Z,2019-03-29T09:24:54Z,2019-03-29T09:24:22Z,256-273,NA,NA,111,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\ZPVELDF9\McIntosh et al. - 2019 - Meta-analysis of the visuospatial aftereffects of .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LM8QUJFJ\S001094521830385X.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Meta-analysis; Landmark task; Line bisection; Neglect; Prism adaptation; Pseudoneglect,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001412

In addition to cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), retinal photoreceptors, mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, and a discrete subpopulation of thalamic neurons also degenerate in the mutant brains. The gene responsible for the pcd mutant is Nna1, also known as ATP/GTP binding protein 1 or cytosolic carboxypeptidase-like 1, which encodes a zinc carboxypeptidase protein. To investigate pathogenesis of the pcd mutation in detail, we generated a conditional Nna1 allele targeting the carboxypeptidase domain at C-terminus. After Cre recombination and heterozygous crossing, we generated Nna1 knockout (KO) mice and found that the Nna1 KO mice began to show cerebellar ataxia at postnatal day 20 (P20). Most PCs degenerated until 4-week-old, except lobule X. Activated microglia and astrocytes were also observed in the Nna1 KO cerebellum. In the mutant brain, the Nna1 mRNA level was dramatically reduced, suggesting that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay occurs in it. Since the Nna1 protein acts as a de-glutamatase on the C-terminus of α-tubulin and ?-tubulin, increased polyglutamylated tubulin was detected in the Nna1 KO cerebellum. In addition, the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), was up-regulated in the mutant PCs. We report the generation of a functional Nna1 conditional allele and possible mechanisms of PC death in the Nna1 KO in the cerebellum.

The four words included either the target word (e.g., 魚 /sakana/; fish), an orthographic competitor (e.g., 角 /tuno/; horn), a phonological competitor (e.g., 桜 /sakura/; cherry blossom), or an unrelated word (e.g., 本 /hon/; book), together with three distractor words. The orthographic competitor was orthographically or phonologically dissimilar to the target in hiragana. In Experiment 1, target and orthographic competitor words attracted more fixations than unrelated words before the target word was mentioned, suggesting that participants pre-activated orthographic form of the target word. In Experiment 2, target and phonological competitor words attracted more predictive fixations than unrelated words, but orthographic competitor words did not, suggesting a critical role of the visual context.

We propose that for these students, academic persistence may hinge on their perceptions of socioeconomic mobility, or their general beliefs regarding whether or not socioeconomic mobility—a powerful academic motivator—can occur in their society. Specifically, low-SES students' desire to persist on a primary path to mobility (i.e., school) should remain strong if they believe that socioeconomic mobility can occur in their society. By contrast, those who believe that socioeconomic mobility generally does not occur should be less motivated to persist academically. One correlational and two experimental studies provide support for this hypothesis among low (but not high) SES high school and university students.

Observers of this kind of behavior have been shown to react negatively in such situations, and in extreme cases, may even leave their group. The current work set out to test how this reaction might be prevented. We assumed that group-norm affirmations can buffer leaving intentions in response to group-norm violations and tested three potential mechanisms underlying the buffering effect of group-norm affirmations. To this end, we conducted three experiments in which we manipulated group-norm violations and group-norm affirmations. In Study 1, we found group-norm affirmations to buffer leaving intentions after group-norm violations. However, we did not find support for the assumption that group-norm affirmations change how a behavior is evaluated or preserve group members' identification with their group. Thus, neither of these variables can explain the buffering effect of group-norm affirmations. Studies 2 & 3 revealed that group-norm affirmations instead reduce perceived effectiveness of the norm-violator, which in turn predicted lower leaving intentions.

By coding nonverbal behaviors displayed in political speeches, we assessed the virtues and vices of 151 U.S. senators. We found that virtuous senators became more influential after they assumed leadership roles, whereas senators who displayed behaviors consistent with vices—particularly psychopathy—became no more influential or even less influential after they assumed leadership roles. Our results inform a long-standing debate about the role of morality and ethics in leadership and have important implications for electing effective government officials.

To date, only a very small fraction of these data have been digitized as part of the MIDAS dataset, and exclusively after 1950. Using the recently-scanned UK Met Office Monthly Weather Reports (MWR), which are based on a subset of the observations that form the DWR, we here provide digitized data and a summary of thunderdays from 10 long-running British stations over the period 1884–1993. The data are presented ‘as is’, with no attempt to provide any corrections or calibration. For 4 of the 10 stations, thunderday observations were discontinued at various times between 1949 and 1964, and it is necessary to switch to a neighbouring station in order to continue the series. Approximately half the series exhibit sharp drops in thunderdays at various points between 1960 and 1990, although none are coincident with known station changes. Comparison with nearby MIDAS stations suggests the low thunderdays are the result of changes in observing practice, rather than genuine changes in thunderstorm occurrence. These potential data issues limit interpretation of the long-term trends. However, it can nevertheless be concluded that none of the stations show the expected increase in thunderdays as a result of the rise in surface temperature over the 20th century. In order to provide more quantitative determination of the long-term trends in thunderstorm occurrence, we advocate further digitization efforts to recover the data from the numerous stations in the MWRs, and subsequent analysis of the common signals across neighbouring stations.",2019,2020-02-03T04:49:34Z,2020-02-03T04:50:05Z,2020-02-03T04:49:34Z,222-233,NA,2,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 The Authors.

The present research identifies hormonal factors as a critical moderator of the diversity-performance connection. Integrating the diversity, status, and hormone literatures, we predicted that groups collectively low in testosterone, which orients individuals less toward status competitions and more toward cooperation, would excel with greater group diversity. In contrast, groups collectively high in testosterone, which is associated with a heightened status drive, would be derailed by diversity. Analysis of 74 randomly assigned groups engaged in a group decision-making exercise provided support for these hypotheses. The findings suggest that diversity is beneficial for performance, but only if group-level testosterone is low; diversity has a negative effect on performance if group-level testosterone is high. Too much collective testosterone maximizes the pains and minimizes the gains from diversity.",2018-06,2019-04-06T18:00:01Z,2019-04-06T18:00:06Z,2019-04-06T18:00:01Z,859-867,NA,6,29,NA,NA,Hormone-Diversity Fit,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3ESNNLVV\Akinola e.a. - 2018 - Hormone-Diversity Fit Collective Testosterone Mod.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001428

We extend this research by moving beyond depletion to examine a more nuanced, process-based view of self-control. We draw on integrative self-control theory (Kotabe & Hofmann, 2015) to identify two critical moderators of the relationship between sleep and unethical behavior. Whereas prior research has focused mainly on the deleterious effects associated with depleted control capacity – such as sleep deprivation – we suggest that factors influencing control motivation and control effort are also an essential part of the self-regulatory process. First, we examine the role of control motivation, hypothesizing that a perceived sense of power moderates the relationship between sleep deprivation and depletion by motivating agentic, goal-directed action that mitigates the depleting effect of sleep deprivation. Second, we consider the role of control effort, hypothesizing that contemplation moderates the relationship between depletion and unethical behavior, such that depleted individuals are less likely to act unethically when contemplation is high. Three studies – one manipulating sleep deprivation in the lab and two using natural variation in sleep quality and quantity – suggest consistent support for our expanded model combining mediation and moderation, advancing self-regulatory research linking sleep deprivation to unethical behavior.",2018-05-01,2018-04-05T06:49:04Z,2018-04-05T06:49:14Z,2018-04-05T06:49:04Z,142-154,NA,NA,76,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Overcoming the effects of sleep deprivation on unethical behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A5F4SPQA\Welsh et al. - 2018 - Overcoming the effects of sleep deprivation on une.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\U2RIFNH3\S0022103117306236.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Contemplation; Depletion; Power; Self-regulation; Sleep deprivation; Unethical behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001430

To answer this question, we attempted to decode the orientation of the stimulus on the previous trial from the electroencephalogram on the current trial in a working memory task. Behavioral data confirmed that the previous-trial stimulus orientation influenced the reported orientation on the current trial, even though the previous-trial orientation was now task irrelevant. In two independent experiments, we found that the previous-trial orientation could be decoded from the current-trial electroencephalogram, indicating that the current-trial stimulus reactivated or boosted the representation of the previous-trial orientation.

Our experimental results confirmed these predictions: An indulgent common consequence more than doubled the rate of disciplined choices. We used eye-gaze data to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms, finding that an indulgent common consequence biased eye gaze toward healthful foods.

Electroencephalographic recordings (CSD estimate), revealed the sequence of cortical activities that lead, or not, to conscious detection. Besides medio-prefrontal activities related to action monitoring and error detection, the motor command sent by the primary motor cortices also differed between detected and undetected partial errors: while it develops identically, it is stopped earlier for the latter than for the former, suggesting a critical role in partial error detection. Second, the analysis of the “Error positivity” – Pe, classically linked to error awareness, confirmed its absence just after partial errors, be they detected or not.

Across three experiments, we found that participants generally rated the target as more racist, less attractive, less dateable, and were less personally willing to have relations with him if he disclosed racial preferences than if he did not. Even participants who believed that having racial preferences is not racist consistently rated a target disclosing racial preferences as more racist, largely less dateable, and were less personally willing to have relations with him.

Counter to this intuitive view, we showed in the present research that the motor system also contributes to judgments of perceptual confidence. In two experiments, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to manipulate response-specific representations in the premotor cortex, selectively disrupting postresponse confidence in visual discrimination judgments. Specifically, stimulation of the motor representation associated with the unchosen response reduced confidence in correct responses, thereby reducing metacognitive capacity without changing visual discrimination performance. Effects of TMS on confidence were observed when stimulation was applied both before and after the response occurred, which suggests that confidence depends on late-stage metacognitive processes.

We study Germany—a country with pronounced local-level variation in inheritance customs—and find that municipalities that historically equally apportioned wealth, to this day, elect more women into political councils and have fewer aristocrats in the social elite. Using historic data, we point to two mechanisms: wealth equality and pro-egalitarian preferences.

The current study utilized the social accuracy model to investigate the effects of differences in thin slices of information quantity on the distinctive accuracy and normativity of personality trait judgments. It was hypothesized that distinctive accuracy and normativity would increase as information quantity increased. Participants were 431 individuals who participated in an online study that varied the length of stimulus target observations (30 seconds, 1 minute, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes), after which judges rated targets using other-report measures of the Big Five personality traits. For all traits combined, significant levels of accuracy were found for all observation lengths, but distinctive accuracy and normativity did not increase as video length increased. Findings varied for individual traits. For distinctive accuracy, there was a linear increase with information quantity for Extraversion and a non-linear relationship for Conscientiousness, while there was a linear decrease for Openness. For normativity, there was a linear increase with information quantity for Agreeableness and a non-linear relationship for Conscientiousness.

Although people generally cooperate with others and view others' “true selves” as intrinsically good, we suggest that they are likely to assume that the actions of others are evil—at least when they are ambiguous. Nine experiments provide support for promiscuous condemnation: the general tendency to assume that ambiguous actions are immoral. Both cognitive and functional arguments support the idea of promiscuous condemnation. Cognitively, dyadic completion suggests that when the mind perceives some elements of immorality (or harm), it cannot help but perceive other elements of immorality. Functionally, assuming that ambiguous actions are immoral helps people quickly identify potential harm and provide aid to others. In the first seven experiments, participants often judged neutral nonsense actions (e.g., “John pelled”) as immoral, especially when the context surrounding these nonsense actions included elements of immorality (e.g., intentionality and suffering). In the last two experiments, participants showed greater promiscuous condemnation under time pressure, suggesting an automatic tendency to assume immorality that people must effortfully control.",2020-01-01,2020-02-06T02:09:47Z,2020-02-07T00:24:58Z,2020-02-06T02:09:47Z,103910,NA,NA,86,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Promiscuous condemnation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KSG2T3RA\Hester et al. - 2020 - Promiscuous condemnation People assume ambiguous .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\KS4NI8KL\S0022103118306942.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Altruism; Ambiguity; Dual process models; Moral judgments; Suspicion,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001456

It is capable of inducing pro-survival activity in serum-deprived human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and fibroblasts by increasing mitochondrial metabolism. We hypothesize that it could promote neuronal survival by acting on neuroenergetics. Our study reveals that treatment of primary mouse cortical neurons cultured in neurobasal medium lacking B27 supplement with rLosac led to an enhancement of cell viability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In parallel, preserved or enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, p44, and p42 MAPK, as well as mTOR was observed following treatment with rLosac. During deprivation, as assessed by western blot and qRT-PCR, protein and mRNA expression of MCT2 (the predominant neuronal monocarboxylate transporter allowing lactate use as an alternative energy substrate) decreased significantly in B27 supplement-deprived cortical neurons and was hardly detected after 24 h of deprivation. Interestingly, rLosac maintained MCT2 protein expression after 24 h of deprivation including at the cell surface without preventing mRNA loss. MCT2 knockdown reduced rLosac-enhanced cell viability, confirming its involvement in rLosac effect. Enhanced uptake of lactate was detected following rLosac treatment and might contribute to rLosac-enhanced viability during deprivation. In the presence of both lactate and rLosac, cell viability was higher than in the presence of lactate alone. Our observations suggest that rLosac promotes cell viability in stressed (B27 supplement-deprived) neurons by facilitating the use of lactate as energy substrate via the preservation of MCT2 protein expression.

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence from Ekstrand et al. (2019) suggests that lexical reading is more associated with reflexive attentional orienting regions, whereas sublexical reading is more associated with voluntary attentional orienting regions. The current research sought to further examine the neuroanatomical relationship between reading and attention using a novel experimental design in fMRI. Participants performed four hybrid attentional orienting and reading-aloud tasks, where a reflexive or voluntary spatial cue preceded a lexical or sublexical target. Results indicated that lexical reading resulted in greater activation in the right temporoparietal junction, a reflexive orienting region. Sublexical reading resulted in greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left fusiform and inferior temporal gyrus, and right superior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus (voluntary orienting regions).

Current interpretations of this post-boundary preview difficulty effect range from delayed parafoveal-on-foveal effects in parallel word-processing models to forced fixations in serial word-processing models. However, these findings are based on an experimental design that, while allowing to isolate preview difficulty effects, might have established a bias with respect to asymmetries in parafoveal preview benefit for high-frequent and low-frequent target words. Here, we present a revision of this paradigm varying the preview’s lexical frequency and keeping the target word constant. We found substantial effects of the preview difficulty in fixation durations after the boundary confirming that preview processing affects the oculomotor decisions not only via trans-saccadic integration of preview and target word information. An additional time-course analysis showed that the preview difficulty effect was significant across the full fixation duration distribution on the target word without any evidence on the pretarget word before the boundary.

Participants who performed the task in their native tongue replicated the illusion of causality effect, whereas those performing the task in their foreign language were more accurate in detecting that the two events were causally unrelated.

Can states of hunger and satiety play the role of context? In two experiments, rats learned a food-seeking response that earned sucrose or sweet, fatty food pellets while they were satiated. Responding was then inhibited (i.e., extinguished) while the rats were hungry. On the rats’ return to the satiated state, their food seeking was renewed.

Effects of spatial compatibility are usually explained by a match or mismatch of automatic behavioural tendencies and intentional mapping processes. The question is whether actors develop such behavioural tendencies for an avatar and thereby are able to neglect their own perspective. In the experiments, actors take the perspective of the avatar and pressed ipsilateral or contralateral left–right keys in response to lateralised coloured discs. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that compatibility effects are tied to the avatar but not to the actor. Experiment 3 revealed that participants could ignore the perspective of the avatar.

Our reanalysis (N = 4,842) indicates that individual biases did not return to preexisting levels. Instead, campus means returned to preexisting campus means, whereas individual scores fluctuated mostly randomly. Campus means were predicted by markers of structural inequality.

These relations should lead to categorical perception, such that viewers find it easier to notice a change that crosses a category boundary (one object is now above, rather than below, another, or now contains, rather than overlaps with, another) than a change of equal magnitude that does not cross a boundary. We tested the influence of a set of topological categorical relations from the cognitive-modeling literature.

The reason for the asymmetry is that people avoid rechoosing alternatives that previously led to poor outcomes; hence, additional feedback on their qualities is precluded. Negative quality estimates, even when caused by noise, thus tend to persist. This negative bias takes time to develop, and affects old alternatives more strongly than similar but newer alternatives.

Novel information is viewed as a driving factor to update memory; however, it is unknown whether different forms of novelty play the same role. In addition, although pharmacological intervention studies have confirmed that prediction error (PE) during reactivation is a necessary condition in memory destabilization, the role of PE in retrieval extinction has remained under debate; furthermore, the neural mechanisms underlying the process are largely unknown. In this study, we isolated two forms of novelty: PE and stimulus novelty without PE during reactivation to compare their role in memory lability. Skin conductance responses (SCR) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to clarify their role at the behavioural and neural mechanism levels. A total of 54 healthy adults were tested in a three-day retrieval extinction protocol. The results showed that PE, the novelty of CS-US combinations, was a critical condition to destabilize memory. The novelty of the stimulus itself with the absence of PE was insufficient for retrieving the memory. The neural mechanisms that distinguished standard extinction from retrieval extinction were that the latter was associated with a diminished recruitment of the inferior temporal cortex (IT) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and decreased functional connectivity of the dlPFC-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and IT-dlPFC.

A large body of research has implicated left parietal regions in symbolic number processing. One possible explanation for this lateralization of neural activity is the handedness of participants. Specifically, participants in neuroimaging research are almost exclusively right-handed. The current study sought to probe whether number representation in the brain is associated with hand preference for handwriting. To address this question, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activation of a group of right-handed participants with a group of left-handed participants during the passive viewing of symbolic numbers. At the whole-brain level, the right-handers demonstrated a previously obtained left-lateralized effect within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The left-handers showed some evidence of reverse lateralization of this effect in the IPS. However, when the groups were statistically compared, we found no regions that demonstrated group-level differences. In a follow-up region of interest (ROI) analysis within the left and right parietal lobes, we calculated laterality indices for each participant. Results did not provide support for group differences in laterality within the right or left IPS ROI.

DCN neurons are enwrapped in densely organized extracellular matrix structures, known as perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are typically found around fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin but interestingly also exist surrounding other neurons, such as the neurons in the DCN and medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, which are the post-synaptic neurons of large axo-somatic synapses adapted for fast signaling. This characteristic localization prompted the hypothesis that PNNs might play a role in the maintenance and formation of large fast-signaling synapses. To elucidate the role of the PNN at these synapses, we investigated the electrophysiological and morphological properties of DCN synapses in hyaluronan and proteoglycan binding link protein 4 (Hapln4/Bral2) knockout (KO) mice around postnatal day (P)14. Hapln4/Bral2 is important for PNN structure, as it stabilizes the interaction between hyaluronan and proteoglycan. Here, using immunohistochemistry we show that Hapln4/Bral2 localized closely with GABAergic terminals. In DCN neurons of Hapln4/Bral2 KO mice, inhibitory synaptic strengths were reduced as compared to those in wild-type mice, whereas the properties of excitatory synapses were unaffected. The reduced IPSC amplitudes were mainly because of reduced numbers of releasable vesicles. Moreover, Hapln4/Bral2 deficiency reduced the number of PC GABAergic terminals in the DCN. These results demonstrate that Hapln4/Bral2 is a PNN component that selectively contributes to formation and transmission of PC-DCN synapses in the cerebellum.

All noradrenergic signalling provided by this nucleus is dependent on an intrinsic pacemaker process. Our study aims to understand how noradrenergic neurons finely tune their pacemaker processes and regulate their activities. Here we present that mitochondrial perturbation in the LC from mice, inhibits spontaneous firing by a hyperpolarizing response that involves Ca2+ entry via L-type Ca2+ channels and the actin cytoskeleton. We found that pharmacological perturbation of mitochondria from LC neurons using the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), induced a dominant hyperpolarizing response when electrophysiological approaches were performed. Surprisingly, the CCCP-induced hyperpolarizing response was dependent on L-type Ca2+ channel-mediated Ca2+ entry, as it was inhibited by: the removal of extracellular Ca2+; the addition of Cd2+; nifedipine or nicardipine; but not by the intracellular dialysis with the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-Bis(2-Aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, the latter indicating that the response was not because of a global change in [Ca2+]c but does not exclude action at intracellular microdomains. Further to this, the incubation of slices with cytochalasin D, an agent that depolymerises the actin cytoskeleton, inhibited the hyperpolarizing response indicating an involvement of the actin cytoskeleton. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a crosstalk between mitochondria and L-type Ca2+ channels leading to modulation of noradrenergic neuronal activity mediated by the actin cytoskeleton.

Because we measure both preferences and policies on the same scale (U.S. dollars), we can quantify both the association of policy outcomes with preferences across states (responsiveness) and their deviation within states (bias). We demonstrate that while minimum wages respond to corresponding preferences across states, policy outcomes are more conservative than preferences in each state, with the average policy bias amounting to about two dollars.

For example, stress reactivity—operationalized as the within-person coupling of stress and positive or negative affect—is an important predictor of various (mental) health outcomes and has often been assumed to be a more or less stable personality trait. However, issues of reliability of these couplings have been largely neglected so far. In this work, we present an estimate for the reliability of within-person couplings that can be easily obtained using the user-modifiable R code accompanying this work. Results of a simulation study show that this index performs well even in the context of unbalanced data due to missing values. We demonstrate the application of this index in a measurement burst study targeting the reliability and test–retest correlation of stress reactivity estimates operationalized as within-person couplings in a daily diary design. Reliability and test–retest correlations of stress reactivity estimates were rather low, challenging the implicit assumption of stress reactivity as a stable person-level variable.

We conclude that nudging is a valuable approach that should be used more often in conjunction with traditional policies, but more calculations are needed to determine the relative effectiveness of nudging.",2017-08-01,2018-03-20T00:13:51Z,2018-03-20T00:14:02Z,2018-03-20T00:13:51Z,1041-1055,NA,8,28,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\I42LW8B2\Benartzi et al. - 2017 - Should Governments Invest More in Nudging.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001483

Here we show that even a single instance of mental imagery can improve attentional selection of a target more effectively than actually practicing visual search. By recording subjects’ brain activity, we found that these imagery-induced training effects were due to perceptual attention being more effectively focused on targets following imagined training. Next, we examined the downside of this potent training by changing the target after several trials of training attention with imagery and found that imagined search resulted in more potent interference than actual practice following these target changes. Finally, we found that proactive interference from task-irrelevant elements in the visual displays appears to underlie the superiority of imagined training relative to actual practice. Our findings demonstrate that visual attention mechanisms can be effectively trained to select target objects in the absence of visual input, and this results in more effective control of attention than practicing the task itself.",2015-07-01,2018-03-20T04:48:31Z,2018-03-20T04:48:39Z,2018-03-20T04:48:31Z,1114-1122,NA,7,26,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\9Z6QNVJ8\Reinhart et al. - 2015 - Visualizing Trumps Vision in Training Attention.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001484

Further, these associations held when controlling for implicit affective associations and explicit prejudice. Manipulating people's metacognitive beliefs about the validity of their implicit associations shifted whether implicit Black-poor associations predicted support for wealth redistribution (Study 3).

These results were obtained using different indicators of health status, including both self-reported and interviewer-administered physical measures. Longitudinal mediation analyses showed perceived constraints to mediate the effect of poor health on cynicism. This effect remained robust even when adding an alternative mediator—depressive symptoms. Additional analyses showed that any particular health limitation was prospectively related to cynicism to the degree to which this limitation was associated with an increased sense of constraints in individuals' life. © 2018 The Authors.

We test our predictions using multiple data sets at different levels of analysis: firm-level data on MNEs' foreign subsidiaries, data on bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) positions, and longitudinal data on bilateral FDI flows. We find that states with independent judiciaries are particularly attractive to investment from countries also possessing independent courts.

For example, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) mediates myelin-to-axon adhesion and signalling via molecules on the axonal surface. However, knowledge about intracellular binding partners of myelin proteins, including MAG, has remained limited. The two splice isoforms of MAG, S- and L-MAG, display distinct cytoplasmic domains and spatiotemporal expression profiles. We used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify interaction partners of L-MAG and found the dynein light chain DYNLL1 (also termed dynein light chain 8). DYNLL1 homodimers are known to facilitate dimerization of target proteins. L-MAG and DYNLL1 associate with high affinity, as confirmed with recombinant proteins in vitro. Structural analyses of the purified complex indicate that the DYNLL1-binding segment is localized close to the L-MAG C terminus, next to the Fyn kinase Tyr phosphorylation site. The crystal structure of the complex between DYNLL1 and its binding segment on L-MAG shows 2 : 2 binding in a parallel arrangement, indicating a heterotetrameric complex. The homology between L-MAG and previously characterized DYNLL1-ligands is limited, and some details of binding site interactions are unique for L-MAG. The structure of the complex between the entire L-MAG cytoplasmic domain and DYNLL1, as well as that of the extracellular domain of MAG, were modelled based on small-angle X-ray scattering data, allowing structural insights into L-MAG interactions on both membrane surfaces. Our data imply that DYNLL1 dimerizes L-MAG, but not S-MAG, through the formation of a specific 2 : 2 heterotetramer. This arrangement is likely to affect, in an isoform-specific manner, the functions of MAG in adhesion and myelin-to-axon signalling.

Here, we demonstrated the phenomenon of vicarious optimism and showed that it arises from concern for others. Participants predicted the likelihood of unpleasant future events that could happen to either themselves or others. In addition to showing an optimistic learning bias for events affecting themselves, people showed vicarious optimism when learning about events affecting friends and strangers. Vicarious optimism for strangers correlated with generosity toward strangers, and experimentally increasing concern for strangers amplified vicarious optimism for them.

On the basis of the inaction-effect bias, we theorized that negative feedback results in the tendency to take action, regardless of what that action may be. In four experiments, we demonstrated that people facing escalation-decision situations were indeed action oriented and that framing escalation as action and de-escalation as inaction resulted in a stronger tendency to escalate than framing de-escalation as action and escalation as inaction (mini-meta-analysis effect d = 0.37, 95% confidence interval = [0.21, 0.53]).",2018-04,2019-04-06T17:45:30Z,2019-04-06T17:45:42Z,2019-04-06T17:45:30Z,537-548,NA,4,29,NA,NA,When Action-Inaction Framing Leads to Higher Escalation of Commitment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Crossref,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\T74STKP9\Feldman en Wong - 2018 - When Action-Inaction Framing Leads to Higher Escal.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,OSBadgePreregisteredPlus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a001502

We conducted a systematic review focusing on: 1) processes of POP maternal transfer, 2) challenges and opportunities to synthesizing current knowledge on POP concentrations in eggs, and 3) a meta-analysis of patterns in current egg pollution data. Results suggest selective maternal transfer of individual compounds. These relate to biological factors such as the foraging and remigration behavior, and to the selective mobilization of POPs during vitellogenesis, such as increased diffusion limitation for lipophilic POPs and slower release and higher reabsorption of apolar POPs. A key gap relates to knowledge of further selective toxicokinetics during embryonic development, as research to date has mainly focused on initial uptake into eggs. Challenges in the synthesis of current data on egg contamination profiles relate to methodological differences, varying analytical approaches, restricted data access, and reporting transparency among studies. To increase opportunities in the use of current data, we propose best practice guidelines, and synthesize a database on POP concentrations within sea turtle eggs. The meta-analysis revealed a geographical and taxonomic bias on the West Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, with most studies conducted on green turtles. Concentrations of POPs show temporal patterns related to trends in usage, production, release, and persistence in the environment, often with regional patterns. The trophic level has the potential to influence POP patterns with higher concentrations in loggerheads compared to other species, but this is confounded by temporal and geographic trends. We argue for more mechanistically process-focused and methodologically comparable research.

In the current study, we used separable, functionally well-characterized electrophysiological indices of lexico-semantic and syntactic processes to demonstrate RH sensitivity to syntactic violations among right-handers with a strong manual preference.

In the present article, we examine the role of cognitive flexibility as a correlate of long-term-oriented behaviour in the domain of environmental conservation. In a first study (N = 143), we explored potential associations between multiple self-report scales and performance-based measures of cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour. Based on its results, we conducted a pre-registered confirmatory study (N = 264) focusing on the most promising correlations found in our exploratory study. This study generated conclusive support for a positive medium-sized correlation between cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour. Exploratory hierarchical regression analyses further revealed that cognitive flexibility accounted for a small portion of variance in pro-environmental behaviour above and beyond the Big Five. While appearing robust on the level of self-reports, the relationship between cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour did not reliably extend to the level of performance tasks, possibly because of their relatively specific scope. These results illustrate the contribution of cognitive flexibility to understanding individual differences in long-term-oriented, pro-environmental behaviour. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:45:05Z,2020-01-30T12:46:38Z,2020-01-30T12:45:05Z,488-505,NA,4,33,NA,NA,Cognitive Flexibility and Pro-environmental Behaviour,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YN5UHTGK\Lange and Dewitte - 2019 - Cognitive Flexibility and Pro-environmental Behavi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LIEW3P6T\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,OSBadgePreregisteredPlus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,self-regulation; cognitive flexibility; executive functioning; pro-environmental behaviour,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a001505

Although there is a long history of research into thought control, the inherent subjectivity of thoughts has made objective examination, and thus mechanistic understanding, difficult. Here, we report a novel method to objectively investigate thought-control success and failure by measuring the sensory strength of visual thoughts using binocular rivalry, a perceptual illusion. Across five experiments (N = 67), we found that thought-control failure may occur because of the involuntary and antithetical formation of nonreportable sensory representations during attempts at thought suppression but not during thought substitution. Notably, thought control was worse in individuals with high levels of anxiety and schizotypy but more successful in mindful individuals. Overall, our study offers insight into the underlying mechanisms of thought control and suggests that individual differences play an important role in the ability to control thoughts.",2019-06-01,2020-01-29T05:56:30Z,2020-01-29T05:57:08Z,2020-01-29T05:56:30Z,811-821,NA,6,30,NA,Psychol Sci,Measuring Thought-Control Failure,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\54FS7APF\Kwok et al. - 2019 - Measuring Thought-Control Failure Sensory Mechani.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,open data; binocular rivalry; mental imagery; mindfulness; thought substitution; thought suppression,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001507

Reliable measures are essential to draw robust inferences from statistical analyses, and subpar reliability has severe implications for measures’ validity and interpretation. Without examining and reporting the reliability of measurements used in an analysis, it is nearly impossible to ascertain whether results are robust or have arisen largely from measurement error. In this article, we propose that researchers adopt a standard practice of estimating and reporting the reliability of behavioral assessments of cognitive processing. We illustrate the need for this practice using an example from experimental psychopathology, the dot-probe task, although we argue that reporting reliability is relevant across fields (e.g., social cognition and cognitive psychology). We explore several implications of low measurement reliability and the detrimental impact that failure to assess measurement reliability has on interpretability and comparison of results and therefore research quality. We argue that researchers in the field of cognition need to report measurement reliability as routine practice so that more reliable assessment tools can be developed. To provide some guidance on estimating and reporting reliability, we describe the use of bootstrapped split-half estimation and intraclass correlation coefficients to estimate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively. For future researchers to build upon current results, it is imperative that all researchers provide psychometric information sufficient for estimating the accuracy of inferences and informing further development of cognitive-behavioral assessments.",2019-12-01,2020-01-14T07:16:11Z,2020-01-14T07:16:24Z,2020-01-14T07:16:11Z,378-395,NA,4,2,NA,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TGAFTKJW\Parsons et al. - 2019 - Psychological Science Needs a Standard Practice of.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,reliability; psychometrics; open materials; cognitive-behavioral tasks; estimating and reporting,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001508

Lower humanness ratings subsequently predicted increased aggression toward her in a behavioral measure of aggression. This effect was moderated by trait intrasexual competitiveness; lower humanness ratings translated into more aggression, but only for women scoring relatively high on intrasexual competition.

We showed that intrusive memories were virtually abolished by playing the computer game Tetris following a memory-reactivation task 24 hr after initial exposure to experimental trauma.

We show that the ability of these models to adjust for unobserved time-invariant confounders comes at the expense of dynamic causal relationships, which are permitted under an alternative selection-on-observables approach. Using the nonparametric directed acyclic graph, we highlight two key causal identification assumptions of unit fixed effects models: Past treatments do not directly influence current outcome, and past outcomes do not affect current treatment. Furthermore, we introduce a new nonparametric matching framework that elucidates how various unit fixed effects models implicitly compare treated and control observations to draw causal inference. By establishing the equivalence between matching and weighted unit fixed effects estimators, this framework enables a diverse set of identification strategies to adjust for unobservables in the absence of dynamic causal relationships between treatment and outcome variables. We illustrate the proposed methodology through its application to the estimation of GATT membership effects on dyadic trade volume.",2019,2020-01-29T00:43:52Z,2020-01-29T00:44:23Z,2020-01-29T00:43:52Z,467-490,NA,2,63,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"©2019, Midwest Political Science Association",NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PAGSSY99\Imai and Kim - 2019 - When Should We Use Unit Fixed Effects Regression M.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7ERIKFRP\ajps.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001517

A total of 21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched healthy controls completed an interactive computer game with an on-screen avatar that participants believed was controlled by an off-screen partner. On social trials, participants were required to achieve joint attention by correctly interpreting and responding to gaze cues. Participants also completed non-social trials in which they responded to an arrow cue within the same task context. While patients and controls took equivalent time to process communicative intent from gaze shifts, patients made significantly more errors than controls when responding to the directional information conveyed by gaze, but not arrow, cues. Despite no differences in response times to gaze cues between groups, patients were significantly slower than controls when responding to arrow cues. This is the opposite pattern of results previously observed in autistic adults using the same task and suggests that, despite general impairments in attention orienting or oculomotor control, patients with schizophrenia demonstrate a facilitation effect when responding to communicative gaze cues. Findings indicate a hyper-responsivity to gaze cues of communicative intent in schizophrenia.

Using data collected from a Mechanical Turk sample, we measured persuasiveness using ratings of video-recorded product pitches and examined the relations between psychopathic and general traits and persuasiveness across weaker (improvised) and stronger (scripted) conditions. Boldness exhibited a small, positive relation with perceived persuasiveness in the improvised condition only; conversely, psychopathic traits related to antagonism/meanness and disinhibition exhibited small negative associations with persuasiveness and trust in the scripted condition.

We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during two tasks that employed identical stimulus displays but varied the relative demands for object storage and spatial attention. We found distinct delay-period signatures for an attention task (which required only spatial attention) and a WM task (which invoked both spatial attention and object storage). Although both tasks required active maintenance of spatial information, only the WM task elicited robust contralateral delay activity that was sensitive to mnemonic load.

Na+-dependent, high-affinity GHB transport has long been considered important evidence supporting this hypothesis. However, the molecular identity of such a high-affinity transporter remains unknown. In this study, we sought to identify and characterize GHB synaptic transport through a series of studies using both native and recombinant systems with the ultimate aim of providing evidence to clarify the proposed role of GHB as a neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. Native [3H]GHB transport was studied in isolated rat brain synaptosomes and compared to synaptic membranes. As a targeted approach, GHB was also screened against a panel of Na+-dependent SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters recombinantly expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or tsA201 cells. Finally, the low-affinity GHB transporters, MCT1/2 and SMCT1, were probed as GHB transporters in L-[14C]lactate uptake assays in synaptosomes. We found no evidence of high-affinity [3H]GHB transport in purified rat brain cortical or striatal synaptosomes or at any of the 11 SLC6 transporters tested. Instead, our results indicate the binding of [3H]GHB to an unidentified membrane component, distinct from any of the known GHB targets. In accordance with others, we found that GHB and the analog 3-hydroxycyclopent-1-enecarboxylic acid (HOCPCA) can, in millimolar concentrations, inhibit L-[14C]lactate uptake at MCT1 and/or MCT2 and that this also can occur in synaptosomes. In conclusion, through a variety of in vitro pharmacological studies, we were unsuccessful in identifying a specific synaptic high-affinity transporter for GHB. Our findings emphasize the need to reevaluate GHB's role as a potential neurotransmitter.

Two groups were presented first with phrasal verbs and their meaning before they were prompted to retrieve the particles from memory. The difference between these 2 retrieval groups was that 1 group studied and then retrieved items 1 at a time, while the other group studied and retrieved them in sets. The 2 other groups received the exercises as trial-and-error events, where participants were prompted to guess the particles and were subsequently provided with the correct response. One group was given immediate feedback on each item, while the other group tackled sets of 14 items before receiving feedback. The effectiveness of these exercise implementations was compared through an immediate and a 1-week delayed posttest. The best test scores were obtained when the exercises had served the purpose of retrieval, although this advantage shrank in the delayed posttest (where scores were poor regardless of treatment condition).

Participants with a disability (N = 502) completed online, self-report measures of need to belong, sense of belonging, social support, and positive disability identity. As expected, those who perceived greater social support were more likely to report a sense of belonging (r ranged from .36 to .55, p < .05) and positive disability identity (r ranged from .18 to .41, p < .05). Positive disability identity was more strongly related to sense of belonging in those who self-identify with a disability (z = 4.16, p < .001, Cohen’s q = .40). Also as hypothesized, positive disability identity predicted sense of belonging, even after controlling for the effects of social support and need to belong, in both those who identified with a disability (R2Δ = .12, Cohens f 2 = .14) and those who did not self-identify (R2Δ = .02, Cohens f 2 = .02).

However, they are limited by the difficulty of disambiguating brain activity required to perform a tic, or activity caused by the tic, from brain activity that generates a tic. Inhibiting ticcing following the urge to tic is important to patients' experience of tics and we hypothesize that inhibition of a compelling motor response to a natural urge will differ in TS subjects compared to controls. This study examines the urge to blink, which shares many similarities to premonitory urges to tic. Previous neuroimaging studies with the same hypothesis have used a one-size-fits-all approach to extract brain signal putatively linked to the urge to blink. We aimed to create a subject-specific and blink-timing-specific pathophysiological model, derived from out-of-scanner blink suppression trials, to eventually better interpret blink suppression fMRI data. Eye closure and continuously self-reported discomfort were reported during five blink suppression trials in 30 adult volunteers, 15 with a chronic tic disorder. For each subject, data from four of the trials were used with an empirical mathematical model to predict discomfort from eye closure observed during the remaining trial. The blink timing model of discomfort during blink suppression predicted observed discomfort much better than previously applied models.

The simple mean of time-discomfort curves from each subject's other trials also outperformed older models.

Spouses reported their daily sexual activity and sexual satisfaction for 14 days and their marital satisfaction at baseline and 4 or 6 months later.

Study 1 examined disgust and anger in response to an action that suggests bad moral character (animal cruelty) versus an action that is seen as inherently more wrong (domestic abuse). Animal cruelty was associated with more disgust than domestic abuse was, whereas domestic abuse was associated with more anger. Studies 2 and 3 manipulated character by varying the agent’s desire to cause harm and also varied the action’s harmful consequences.

To better understand how goals are embedded in people's lives across adulthood, the present research examined life goals' content (health, personal growth, prosocial engagement, social relations, status, work), dynamics (interplay between goal importance and goal attainability), and outcomes (subjective well-being) from a developmental perspective. We argue that people rate those goals as important and attainable that enable them to master developmental tasks, that they adapt their goals to personal capacities, and that goals predict subjective well-being after 2 and 4 years. The sample included 973 individuals (18–92 years old, M = 43.00 years) of whom 637 participated 2 years later and 573 participated 4 years later. Goal importance and well-being were assessed at all occasions and goal attainability at the first two occasions. Results indicated that age was negatively associated with importance and attainability of personal-growth, status, and work goals but positively associated with importance and attainability of prosocial-engagement goals. The association between goal importance and attainability was largely bidirectional over time; and goal attainability, rather than goal importance, was positively linked to later well-being.

Further investigation was conducted to understand the relationship between SI-TaP and the annually summed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which could be a proxy of terrestrial vegetation productivity. Results show differences in both spatial patterns and temporal variations between SI-TaP and air temperature and precipitation, but SI-TaP may help to explain the distribution and productivity of terrestrial vegetation. About 60% of regions where annually summed NDVI is greater than half of its maximum value overlap regions where SI-TaP is greater than half of its maximum value.

We previously showed that DHA is a substrate of fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1/SLC27A1), and FATP1 is localized at the abluminal membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells. We hypothesized that amyloid β (Aβ) decreases FATP1-mediated cellular efflux (i.e. supply to the brain) of DHA at the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Here, we tested this hypothesis using a human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line, human cerebral microvessel endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3), as a BBB model. The efflux of DHA-d5 by hCMEC/D3 cells increased time-dependently up to 3 min. Knock-down of FATP1 with specific siRNA indicated that FATP1-mediated efflux accounts for 47.0% of this DHA-d5 efflux. In hCMEC/D3 cells treated with Aβ25–35 (10 μM/24 h), which we employed as an in vitro model of the BBB in AD, FATP1 protein expression in the plasma membrane was decreased by 96.0%, which was greater than the decrease in the whole-cell lysate, and the DHA-d5 efflux was decreased by 68.3%. Of this 68.3% decrease, 45.1% (47.0 × 0.96) is accounted for by the decrease in FATP1-mediated efflux and the remaining 23.2% is presumably mediated by other mechanism(s). Thus, we have established for the first time that FATP1 is a major contributor to DHA efflux from human brain capillary endothelial cells, and its efflux activity at the abluminal membrane of the cells is blocked by Aβ. This may explain the decreased DHA level in the brain of AD patients.

Less is known about the physiological concentration of extracellular calcium in the brain. In electrophysiological brain slice experiments, the artificial cerebrospinal fluid traditionally contains relatively high concentrations of calcium (2-4 mM) to support synaptic transmission and suppress neuronal excitability. Using an ion-selective electrode, we determined the fraction of ionized calcium in healthy human cerebrospinal fluid to 1.0 mM of a total concentration of 1.2 mM (86%). Using patch-clamp and extracellular recordings in the CA1 region in acute slices of rat hippocampus, we then compared the effects of this physiological concentration of calcium with the commonly used 2 mM on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation (LTP) to examine the magnitude of changes in this range of extracellular calcium. Increasing the total extracellular calcium concentration from 1.2 to 2 mM decreased spontaneous action potential firing, induced a depolarization of the threshold, and increased the rate of both de- and repolarization of the action potential. Evoked synaptic transmission was approximately doubled, with a balanced effect between inhibition and excitation. In 1.2 mM calcium high-frequency stimulation did not result in any LTP, whereas a prominent LTP was observed at 2 or 4 mM calcium. Surprisingly, this inability to induce LTP persisted during blockade of GABAergic inhibition. In conclusion, an increase from the physiological 1.2 mM to 2 mM calcium in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid has striking effects on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and the induction of LTP.

Seven studies containing data from nine samples (N = 1086) in two countries (the UK and Brazil) asked participants to compare the meaning of different values found within influential quasi-circumplex model of values. Different methods were used across experiments, including direct similarity judgment tasks, pile sorting, and spatial arrangement. The results of these diverse conceptual assessments corresponded to spatial configurations that are broadly convergent with Schwartz's model, both between and within participants. ? 2018 The Authors.

What is not yet clear is what mechanisms relate the two. In two longitudinal studies, we explored whether extraversion is prospectively associated with higher levels of satisfaction during college through influencing college social experiences using longitudinal cross?lagged mediation models. In both studies, students' extraversion at the beginning of college predicted their subjective well?being 4 years later. In both studies, extraversion at the beginning of college predicted a variety of self?reported and peer?reported social experiences (e.g. feelings of belonging and size of social network). We tested whether qualitative or quantitative aspects of social experiences explained the association between extraversion and subjective well?being. In the first study, neither type of social experience explained the effect of extraversion on satisfaction. Only qualitative social experiences in the second study were instrumental in explaining this effect. The results suggest that extraversion's ability to create better social experiences can play a role in extraverts' greater subjective well?being, but these experiences are not the only reason extraverts are happier and more satisfied.

Altered histone 3 lysine 4 methylation and increased lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1) expression in GBM tumours nonetheless suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in GBM. We engineered a dual-action prodrug, which is activated by the high hydrogen peroxide levels associated with GBM cells. This quinone methide phenylaminecyclopropane prodrug releases the LSD1 inhibitor 2-phenylcyclopropylamine with the glutathione scavenger para-quinone methide to trigger apoptosis in GBM cells. Quinone methide phenylaminocyclopropane impaired GBM cell behaviours in two-dimensional and three-dimensional assays, and triggered cell apoptosis in several primary and immortal GBM cell cultures. These results support our double-hit hypothesis of potentially targeting LSD1 and quenching glutathione, in order to impair and kill GBM cells but not healthy astrocytes. Our data suggest this strategy is effective at selectively targeting GBM and potentially other types of cancers.

Previous research has suggested that this gestural advantage might hold only for gestures that overlap with the semantics of the words. Dual coding theory predicts that learners should learn input better when multiple sensory routes act as aids to retrieval. Our research replicated and extended previous studies examining the limits of gestures in learning L2 vocabulary. A within-participant design directly compared the effects of pairing low idiosyncratic gestures (gestures traditionally iconic with word meanings) versus high idiosyncratic gestures (gestures that likely need to be idiosyncratically paired with word meanings) with L2 vocabulary presentation, relative to using no gestures. Results supported dual coding theory: All gestures were helpful if they were not confusable with other to-be-learned words and if the number of words presented was limited.

We have shown that professional freestyle swimmers at relay positions 2 to 4 swam faster in the relay than in the individual competition if they had a high chance to win a relay medal. After applying a reaction-time correction that controls for different starting procedures in relay and individual competitions, Skorski et al. (2016) conclude that swimmers in relays do not swim faster. At first sight, their results appear to show this very pattern. However, we argue that the authors’ findings and conclusion—that our finding is a myth—are not warranted. First, we have also controlled for quicker reaction times in the relay competition. Our correction has been based on the swimmers’ own reaction time data rather than on a constant reaction time estimate and is, thus, more precise than theirs. Second, Skorski et al. treat data from international and national competitions equally although national relay competitions are less attractive for the swimmers than national individual competitions. This difference likely biases their data towards slower relay times. Third, the authors select a small and arbitrary sample without explicit power considerations or a clear stopping rule. Fourth, they unfavorably aggregate their data. We conclude that the reported results are most likely due to the methodological choices by Skorski et al. and do not invalidate our findings.",2018-08-09,2020-01-29T07:51:36Z,2020-01-29T08:11:09Z,2020-01-29T07:51:36Z,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,No Myth far and wide,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"Copyright (c) 2018 Joachim Hüffmeier, Stefan Krumm",NA,NA,NA,open.lnu.se,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\A9DJHV6M\Hüffmeier and Krumm - 2018 - No Myth far and wide.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\MUXULFUZ\842.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,teams; effort gains; groups; performance gains:; reaction-time correction; relay swimming,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001559

We evaluated α-syn diagnostic performance across a well-characterized patient cohort with long-term follow-up. For this purpose, CSF α-syn levels were determined in 25 subjects diagnosed with stable mild cognitive impairment (stable MCI; n = 25), 27 MCI cases due to AD (MCI-AD; n = 32), 24 MCI cases due to Lewy body disease (MCI-LBD; n = 24) and control subjects (Ctrl; n = 18). CSF α-syn levels discriminate between the four groups. There were higher α-syn levels in MCI-AD patients and lower levels in MCI-LBD patients.

MCI-AD patients with early psychotic symptoms (n = 9) displayed a trend towards a decrease in P-tau and α-syn compared to the MCI-AD patients without psychotic symptoms (n = 23). We conclude that adding CSF α-syn to central core AD biomarkers improves an early differential diagnosis of MCI-AD from other forms of MCI.

We then externally validated models in a community clinic (N = 511) with the same candidate predictors and semistructured interview diagnoses, providing high methodological consistency; the clinics also had substantially different demography and referral patterns.

We present a series of experiments that investigate how people decode the physical form of an articulator to derive imaginary geometrical constructs, which we call “gesture form.” We provide quantitative evidence for several key properties that play a role in this process. First, “profiling,” the ability to focus on a structural subunit within the complex form of the physical hand. Second, “perspective,” for which we show that one and the same handshape seen from different perspectives can lead to different spatial interpretations. Third, “selectivity,” the fact that gestures focus on specific spatial features at the expense of others.

While having widespread theoretical and intuitive appeal, this notion has barely been tested empirically. We used a recently developed paradigm to test whether severely corrupt acts happen gradually or abruptly. The results of four experimental studies revealed a higher likelihood of severe corruption when participants were directly given the opportunity to engage in it (abrupt) compared with when they had previously engaged in minor forms of corruption (gradual). Neither the size of the payoffs, which we kept constant, nor evaluations of the actions could account for these differences.

However, little attention has been paid to how the prior odds (R) that a tested effect is true can affect the probability that a significant result will be replicable. The lower R is, the less likely a published result will be replicable even if power is high. It follows that if R is lower in one set of studies than in another, then all else being equal, published results will be less replicable in the set with lower R. We illustrate this point by presenting an analysis of data from the social-psychology and cognitive-psychology studies that were included in the Open Science Collaboration’s (2015) replication project. We found that R was lower for the social-psychology studies than for the cognitive-psychology studies, which might explain why the rate of successful replications differed between these two sets of studies. This difference in replication rates may reflect the degree to which scientists in the two fields value risky but potentially groundbreaking (i.e., low-R) research. Critically, high-R research is not inherently better or worse than low-R research for advancing knowledge. However, if they wish to achieve replication rates comparable to those of high-R fields (a judgment call), researchers in low-R fields would need to use an especially low alpha level, conduct experiments that have especially high power, or both.",2018-06-01,2020-01-14T06:52:13Z,2020-01-14T06:52:24Z,2020-01-14T06:52:13Z,186-197,NA,2,1,NA,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\CVBYA4BM\Wilson and Wixted - 2018 - The Prior Odds of Testing a True Effect in Cogniti.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,reproducibility; effect size; power; open materials; Bayesian priors; cognitive psychology; prior odds; social psychology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001569

The growing body of evidence suggesting that gastrointestinal inflammation is involved in the development of PD led us to investigate the effects of inflammation on alpha-synuclein expression in primary culture of rat ENS and in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Using western blot and qPCR, we found that both lipopolysaccharide and a combination of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 1-? decreased the expression levels of alpha-synuclein in primary culture of rat ENS, an effect that was prevented in the presence of the p38 inhibitors SB203580 and BIRB 796. Lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin 1-? had no effect on alpha-synuclein expression in primary culture of rat CNS and in human erythroid leukemia cells. In mice, acute but not chronic dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis was associated with a decreased expression of colonic alpha-synuclein. As a whole, our findings indicate that acute inflammatory insults down-regulate alpha-synuclein expression in the ENS via a p38 pathway. They provide new insights into the widely discussed concepts of alpha-synuclein expression and aggregation in the ENS in PD and raise issues about the possible role of gastrointestinal inflammation in the development of PD.

People's willingness and capacity to empathize, however, is often contingent upon the target's group membership – people are less empathic towards those they categorize as out-group members. In competitive or threatening intergroup contexts, people may even feel pleasure (counter-empathy) in response to out-group members' misfortunes. Social dominance orientation (SDO), or the extent to which people prefer and promote group-based inequalities, is an ideological variable that is associated with a competitive view of the world, increased prejudicial attitudes, and decreased empathy. Thus, higher levels of SDO should be associated with reduced empathy and increased counter-empathy in general, but especially towards those whose subjugation maintains group inequalities. Across three studies we show that among White individuals, higher SDO levels are associated with less empathy, and more counter-empathy in response to others' good and bad fortunes. More importantly, these reductions in empathy and increases in schadenfreude as a function of SDO were significantly stronger for Asian and Black targets than for in-group White targets when group boundaries were made salient prior to the empathy ratings. Finally, in a fourth study we show that this phenomenon is not dependent upon a history of status differences: higher SDO scores were associated with decreased empathy and increased counter-empathy for competitive out-group (relative to in-group) targets in a novel group setting.

A well-known study revealed that the norm is strong with Christmas cards, with 20% of people reciprocating a Christmas card received from a stranger. I attempted to conceptually replicate and extend this effect. In Study 1, 755 participants received a Christmas card supposedly from a more- versus less-similar stranger. The reciprocation rate was unexpectedly low (2%), which did not allow for a test of a similarity effect. Two potential reasons for this low rate were examined in Study 2 in which 494 participants reported their likelihood of reciprocating a Christmas card from a stranger as well as their felt suspicions/threat about the card and their frequency of e-mail use. Reciprocation likelihood was negatively correlated with perceived threat/suspicion and e-mail use.

The objective was to determine which approach to measuring intelligibility would be most reliable for predicting listener comprehension, as measured through a listening comprehension test similar to the Test of English as a Foreign Language. The speakers included 18 English users representing six distinct varieties. These speakers? speech was evaluated by 60 listeners, users of the same English varieties who completed the listening comprehension test as well as five intelligibility tasks, all recorded by the speakers. The five measures of intelligibility included responses to true/false statements, scalar ratings of speech, perception of nonsense sentences, perception of filtered sentences, and transcription of speech; these measures were compared in terms of their relationship to listening comprehension scores using linear mixed?effects models. Results showed that the measure of intelligibility based on listeners? responses to nonsense sentences was the strongest predictor of the listening comprehension scores.",2017-10-24,2018-03-23T03:07:11Z,2018-04-04T00:10:51Z,2018-03-23T03:07:11Z,115-146,NA,1,68,NA,Language Learning,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezp.lib.unimelb.edu.au (Atypon),NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\P3ZGA9GI\Kang Okim et al. - 2017 - Empirical Approaches to Measuring the Intelligibil.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\U8E6MNJR\lang.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,assessment; comprehension; English varieties; intelligibility; listening; nonnative,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001574

Though the theory of machine learning has existed since the 1950s, it was not until the advent of advanced computing that their potential has begun to be realized. Gifted education is a field where machine learning has yet to be utilized, even though one of the underlying problems of gifted education is classification, which is an area where learning algorithms have become exceptionally accurate. We provide a brief overview of machine learning with a focus on neural networks and supervised learning, followed by a demonstration using simulated data and neural networks for classification issues with a practical explanation of the mechanics of the neural network and associated R code. Implications for gifted education are then discussed. Finally, the limitations of supervised learning are discussed.

We used the association between the concrete (spatial) and abstract (ideological) components of the political left-right metaphor to demonstrate that metaphorical conflict has marked implications for cognitive processing and social perception. Specifically, we showed that creating conflict between a spatial location and a metaphorically linked concept reduces perceived differences between the attitudes of partisans who are generally viewed as possessing fundamentally different worldviews (Democrats and Republicans). We further demonstrated that metaphorical conflict reduces perceived attitude differences by creating a mind-set in which categories are represented as possessing broader boundaries than when concepts are metaphorically compatible. These results suggest that metaphorical conflict shapes social perception by making members of distinct groups appear more similar than they are generally thought to be. These findings have important implications for research on conflict, embodied cognition, and social perception.",2016-03-01,2018-03-20T01:45:42Z,2018-03-20T01:45:51Z,2018-03-20T01:45:42Z,375-383,NA,3,27,NA,Psychol Sci,When the Spatial and Ideological Collide,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FD8XIZ49\Kleiman et al. - 2016 - When the Spatial and Ideological Collide Metaphor.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2016,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001576

The amygdala is well known to contribute to approach and avoidance behaviors in response to specific sensory stimuli; we tested whether the amygdala’s role might extend to situations in which stimulus information is reduced. In a novel task, 3 patients with rare bilateral amygdala lesions (and control subjects) made approach-related judgments about photos of intact faces and of the same faces with all internal facial features occluded. Direct comparisons of the judgments of these stimuli isolated a default bias. The patients showed a greater tendency than the control subjects to rate occluded faces as more approachable than whole faces.

However, it is not known whether this preference is specific to faces or reflects a more generalised preference in biological stimuli: for example, non-face body parts. Moreover, it is not yet well established whether the preference for carotenoid colouration extends beyond Caucasian populations. Three studies were conducted to address these issues. In Studies 1 and 2, Caucasian and Hong Kong Chinese participants, respectively, selected the more attractive image in pairs of high and low carotenoid colouration versions of images of Caucasian faces and body parts, and also for non-face/body-part control stimuli (scrambled faces). In Study 3, a similar study protocol was used with an independent sample of Hong Kong Chinese participants using stimuli generated from Chinese individuals. The results showed that high carotenoid colouration was preferred across all the three studies in faces and body parts, but not in the control stimuli. In addition, there was a stronger preference for high carotenoid colouration in faces compared with body parts in Studies 1 and 2—although this preference was not observed in Study 3.

The current research provides deeper insight into the stigmatization of single people by understanding their ‘group-y’ nature, and how group identification and perception map onto discrimination and prejudice. Study 1 examined the extent to which singles identify as part of a group. Participants were assigned a novel minimal group identity and then completed measures of group identification for four group memberships (e.g., minimal group, relationship status, sexual orientation, nationality). As hypothesized, singles' identification with other singles was lower compared to their identification with other identities—as well as compared to partnered people's group identification. Contrary to our hypothesis, singles did not perceive less discrimination towards singles relative to other aspects of their identity. Study 2 examined the extent to which singles are perceived as a group and the extent to which their group-y-ness vs. perceived responsibility for their group membership explains the acceptability of prejudice towards them. Participants completed measures of entitativity and perceived responsibility for similar out-group identities as in Study 1 (e.g., single people vs. people in romantic relationships). As hypothesized, singles were rated lower in entitativity than people in romantic relationships and other groups. Prejudice towards singles was also more acceptable than prejudice towards national and sexual orientation groups. Accordingly, perceived responsibility was a stronger predictor of the acceptability of prejudice towards singles than their entitativity. We discuss the importance of group-based theoretical perspectives for understanding the current and future stigmatization and well-being of singles.",2020-01-01,2020-02-06T02:08:44Z,2020-02-07T00:32:03Z,2020-02-06T02:08:44Z,103844,NA,NA,86,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,Are single people a stigmatized ‘group’?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LPQI3SBQ\Fisher and Sakaluk - 2020 - Are single people a stigmatized ‘group’ Evidence .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\3QGI78B7\S0022103119303737.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,os,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Social identity; Entitativity; Prejudice; Group identification; Single people; Stigmatization,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2020,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001580

However, it is not known whether the perceptual systems of dyscalculics have implicit access to the sensory noise of numerosity judgements, and whether their perceptual systems take the noise levels into account in optimizing their perception. We tackled this question by measuring central tendency and serial dependence with a numberline task on dyscalculics and math-typical preadolescents. Numerosity thresholds were also measured with a separate 2AFC discrimination task. Our data confirmed that dyscalculics had poorer numerosity sensitivity and less accurate numberline mapping. Importantly, numberline responses, as well as central tendency and serial dependence strengths, were well predicted by sensory thresholds and could be modelled by a performance-optimizing Bayesian model based on sensory thresholds, suggesting that the functional architecture of systems encoding numerosity in dyscalculia is preserved.

In adult conversations, delays between turns are minimal (typically 200 ms or less) because listeners display a striking ability to predict what their partner will say, and they formulate a response before their partner’s turn ends. Here, we tested how this ability to coordinate comprehension and production develops in preschool children. In an interactive paradigm, 106 children (ages 3–5 years) and 48 adults responded to questions that varied in predictability but were controlled for linguistic complexity. Using a novel distributional approach to data analysis, we found that when children can predict a question’s ending, they leave shorter gaps before responding, suggesting that they can optimize the timing of their conversational turns like adults do. In line with a recent ethological theory of turn taking, this early competency helps explain how conversational contexts support language development.",2019-04-01,2020-01-29T05:38:31Z,2020-01-29T05:39:17Z,2020-01-29T05:38:31Z,504-515,NA,4,30,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\53CZ3BHG\Lindsay et al. - 2019 - Preschoolers Optimize the Timing of Their Conversa.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,prediction; development; open data; conversation; response planning; turn taking,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001582

A laboratory experiment (N = 105) induced a state of ego depletion (i.e., impaired self-control) by having some participants continuously break pre-established motoric habits, and afterward these participants were less willing to make plans for the next four weeks than control participants. A field experiment (N = 112) used a naturally occurring induction of decision fatigue (IKEA shopping) and again found that ego depletion reduced planning. Specifically, fatigued shoppers exiting the store expressed more reluctance to make long-term plans than shoppers who were just arriving at the store. A final laboratory experiment (N = 128) found that ego-depleted participants were only half as likely to choose a planning task as control participants, and identified effort avoidance as a mediator mechanism. Crucially, the three experimental manipulations were longer and stronger than the 5-min depletion tasks often used in previous research (24 min; 2 h; 30 min), and manipulation checks confirmed severe and significant ego depletion. Depletion had no effects on aspirational goals or the desire to relax. We conclude that wants and desires come easily, while planning requires mental work akin to self-control.

While theories of voter turnout and policy preference suggest that politics should influence election administration spending levels in the counties that administer elections, to our knowledge, there has been no evidence produced to support a partisan election administration expenditure effect. This research finds that Republican county commissions in North Carolina spend significantly less on election administration once the county electorate is a sufficient Republican majority. The article presents a novel model and method for estimating election administration spending and calls for additional research to examine the outcomes of these significant differences in spending on election administration.",2019,2020-01-29T00:42:56Z,2020-01-29T00:43:17Z,2020-01-29T00:42:56Z,427-438,NA,2,63,NA,NA,Strategic Spending,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"©2019, Midwest Political Science Association",NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\RZQVCZE7\Mohr et al. - 2019 - Strategic Spending Does Politics Influence Electi.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\LAUTMKLY\ajps.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001584

Being able to overcome such conflicts is a necessary prerequisite in everyday life, because it enables goal-directed behavior. On a conceptual level, different kinds of conflict can be distinguished: conflicts at a stimulus level (S-S conflicts) can be dissociated from stimulus-response (S-R) conflicts. Considering cognitive psychological frameworks, we examined whether simultaneously presented conflicts potentiate each other, or are rather integrated into a single conflict. To assess the neurophysiological mechanisms and functional neuroanatomical structures that are modulated by independent, interfering or integrative processing of conflicts, we use a Simon-Stroop paradigm in combination with EEG recordings and source localization. We show that S-R (Simon) conflict monitoring processes reflected by anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and N2 ERP component modulations are unaffected by simultaneous S-S (Stroop) conflicts. In contrast to that, S-S (Stroop) conflicts, reflected in N450 ERP component and ACC modulations are not processed separately when there is an already existing S-R conflict. Rather, S-S (Stroop) conflicts are likely integrated into previously established S-R conflict resolution and also modulate response selection processes associated with the modulation of the P3 ERP component and dorsolateral prefrontal structures. The results suggest that even though different kinds of conflicts can be distinguished, they can become integrated during neural processing associated with medial frontal areas.",2019-06-01,2020-01-30T07:02:16Z,2020-01-30T07:02:35Z,2020-01-30T07:02:16Z,216-230,NA,NA,115,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\TLLVJ4Y8\Chmielewski and Beste - 2019 - Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the modul.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\J4IQTKX8\S0010945219300589.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Conflict monitoring; EEG; Simon; Source localization; Stroop; Theory of event coding,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001585

We also explored the role of test modality in L2 performance, by including L2 knowledge tests in both aural and visual modes. Native English speakers engaged in meaning-focused integrated practice of 3 German syntactic rules. In Experiment 1, learners were given aural or visual word-by-word (rapid serial visual presentation; RSVP) input and in Experiment 2, they were given aural or natural written input. We found evidence of learning across all 4 groups, but different types of resultant knowledge. In particular, learners gained explicit knowledge in all input modalities, yet only those trained with natural written input also developed robust implicit knowledge.

These goal orientations are linked with academic achievement, and troublingly, students report decreasing levels of goal orientations across the school years. However, little is known concerning the mechanisms that drive this decline. In a large (N = 891 twin pairs) cross-sectional genetically informative sample (age = 8 to 22 years), we found that older students reported lower goal orientations. Then, we identified shifts in the magnitude of genetic and environmental variance in each goal orientation. For example, variance in mastery goal orientation was primarily associated with environmental factors during the elementary school years. As students entered high school, genetic influences increased, replacing shared environmental influences. Finally, we situated these findings in the larger nomological network by testing associations with psychological constructs (e.g. personality and cognitive ability) and contextual variables (e.g. parents, schools, and peers).

Correspondingly, these people exhibited behavioral intentions and decisions intended to conceal or improve their appearance, such as purchasing facial products, taking pharmaceuticals, and undergoing cosmetic surgery. This work opens a new area of investigation for infectious-disease psychology research and highlights the central role played by physical appearance in pathogen-related cognition.",2018-02-01,2018-03-19T23:26:58Z,2018-03-19T23:27:31Z,2018-03-19T23:26:58Z,228-241,NA,2,29,NA,Psychol Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\YPPTB6RB\Ackerman et al. - 2018 - Infectious Disease and Imperfections of Self-Image.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgePreregistered,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001596

An important finding for theory and intervention is that children’s inhibitory control improves if an adult imposes a delay before they can act. Such findings have suggested that the passage of time allows impulsive urges to dissipate passively. However, in prior studies with imposed delays, children were also reminded about what they should be doing, which may have aided their activation of goal-relevant information. We tested this possibility by independently manipulating delays and task reminders, and measuring 3-year-olds’ abilities to inhibit opening boxes in a go/no-go box-search task. Task reminders, but not adult-imposed delays, improved children’s response inhibition. However, as in prior work, children who spontaneously delayed their action longer on go trials exhibited better response inhibition on no-go trials. These results pose a challenge to the view that the passage of time plays a causal role, suggest that spontaneous delays index other processes that improve inhibitory control, and highlight the importance of goal activation in developing inhibitory control.",2015-12-01,2018-03-20T01:55:10Z,2018-03-20T01:55:22Z,2018-03-20T01:55:10Z,1898-1908,NA,12,26,NA,Psychol Sci,Time Isn’t of the Essence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\R9LEX3J5\Barker and Munakata - 2015 - Time Isn’t of the Essence Activating Goals Rather.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001598

This article is the first to test how and when characteristics of active coalitions increase their lobbying success. Based on pluralist theory, one can expect diverse coalitions, uniting different societal interests, to signal broad support to policy makers. Yet, their responsiveness to this signal (i.e., signaling benefits) and contribution incentives within the coalition (i.e., cooperation costs) are likely to vary with issue salience. This theory is tested on a unique data set comprising 50 issues in five European countries. Results reveal a strong moderating effect of salience on the relationship between coalition diversity and success: On less salient issues, homogenous coalitions are more likely to succeed, whereas the effect reverses with higher salience, where diverse coalitions are more successful.

Past models of food preference have assumed that social concerns are dissociated from basic appetitive qualities—such as tastiness—in food choice. In contrast to this notion, we tested and found support for the novel idea that social identities can shape the evaluation of food pleasantness. Specifically, individual differences in social identification (Study 1) as well as experimentally manipulated identity salience (Study 2) were associated with the anticipated tastiness of identity-relevant foods. We also found that identity salience influenced perceived food pleasantness during consumption (Study 3). These results suggest social identity may shape evaluations of food pleasantness, both through long-term motivational components of identification as well as short-term identity salience. Thus, the influence of social identity on cognition appears to extend beyond social evaluation, to hedonic experience.

However, whether and how framing effects occur in experience-based decisions remain important open questions. In three experiments, we demonstrate that the framing effect is less pronounced in experience-than in description-based decisions. We explain this finding on the basis of affective forecasting with losses. In descriptive conditions, individuals overestimate the impact of potential losses on their emotional reactions, whereas experience helps people become aware of their ability to rationalize losses and mitigates this erroneous affective forecasting, thereby reducing the propensity for risk seeking.

An original experiment and ANES data analyses (1980–2004) show that a “good gut feeling” toward a candidate helps citizens to overcome the paralyzing effect of ambivalence on attitude formation and turnout. And, since turnout is most tenuous among those with lower income, this is where the effect is most pronounced.

When cues were consciously visible, participants were unable to discern their relevance and could not use them to enhance switch performance.

If the revelation cost falls in a high range, the risk of whistleblowing convinces executives to restrain themselves. Executives cannot credibly commit to this when the costs are low, resulting in inefficient investigations from watchdog groups that tax executive resources.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Sol and TA MNs adapt to changes in cholinergic environment by differential regulation of their muscarinic receptors M2 (M2R). We examined Chrm2 (M2R gene) transcript level, high-affinity 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate-3H ([3H]QNB) ligand binding, distribution and density of M2R immunolabeling in lumbar (L) segments in intact and SCT rats, with or without inclusion of 5-week treadmill locomotor training. We show that at the second week after SCT the levels of Chrm2 transcript are reduced in the L3?6 segments, with [3H]QNB binding decreased selectively in the L5?6 segments, where ankle extensor MNs are predominantly located. At 5 weeks after SCT, [3H]QNB binding differences between the L3?4 and L5?6 segments are maintained, accompanied by higher density of M2R immunolabeling in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of TA than Sol MNs and by enriched synaptic versus extrasynaptic M2R pools (52% TA vs. 25% Sol MNs). Training normalized M2R in TA MNs, improved locomotion, and reduced frequency of clonic episodes. Our findings indicate higher sensitivity of TA than Sol MNs to cholinergic signaling after SCT, which might shorten flexor twitches duration and contribute to generation of clonic movements. Synaptic enrichment in M2R density may reflect a compensatory mechanism activated in TA and Sol MNs to different extent in response to reduced strength of cholinergic signaling to each MN pool.

In a combined galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the brain areas that underlie both simulated changes in self-location and the processing of vestibular stimulation within the same individuals. Participants performed an egocentric mental rotation task, an object-based mental rotation task, or a pure lateralization task during GVS or sham stimulation. At the neural level, we expected an overlap between brain areas activated during vestibular processing and egocentric mental rotation (against object-based mental rotation) within area OP2 and the Posterior Insular Cortex (PIC), two core brain regions involved in vestibular processing. The fMRI data showed a small overlap within area OP2 and a larger overlap within the PIC for both egocentric mental rotation against object-based mental rotation and vestibular processing. GVS did not influence the ability to perform egocentric mental rotation. Our results provide evidence for shared neural mechanisms underlying perceived and simulated self-motion.

In particular, tree models are very effective for detecting nonlinearities and interactions, even in data sets with many (potentially irrelevant) covariates.

Compared with the average non-welfare-recipient image, the average welfare-recipient image was perceived (by a separate sample) as more African American and more representative of stereotypes associated with welfare recipients and African Americans. In Study 3, participants were asked to determine whether they supported giving welfare benefits to the people pictured in the average welfare-recipient and non-welfare-recipient images generated in Study 2.

We extend our findings to a workplace context, and show that threatened individuals who lie on a job application feel more capable than those who report them honestly (Study 4). Finally, consistent with the argument that counterfeit competence is driven by self-protection, we find individuals do not predict they would experience such a boost (Study 5), and that cheating after threat offers benefits similar to those provided by other established methods of self-protection (Study 6).

The right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a region that has been associated most strongly with spatial remapping. The aim of the project was to investigate the effect of damage to the right PPC on direction specific trans-saccadic memory. We compared trans-saccadic memory performance for central items that had to be remembered while making a left- versus rightward eye movement, or for items that were remapped within the left versus right visual field. Methods We included 9 stroke patients with unilateral right PPC lesions and 31 healthy control subjects. Participants memorized the location of a briefly presented item, had to make one saccade (either towards the left or right, or upward or downward), and subsequently had to decide in what direction the probe had shifted. We used a staircase to adjust task difficulty (i.e., the distance between the memory item and probe). Bayesian repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare left versus right eye movements and items in the left versus right visual field. Results In both conditions, patients with right PPC damage showed worse trans-saccadic memory performance compared to healthy control subjects (for the condition with left- and rightward gaze shifts, BF10 = 3.79; and when items were presented left or right, BF10 = 6.77), regardless of the direction of the gaze or the initial location of the memory item. At the individual level, none of the patients showed a direction specific deficit after leftward versus rightward saccades, whereas two patients showed worse performance for items in the left versus right visual field. Conclusion Damage in the right PPC did not lead to gaze direction specific impairments in trans-saccadic memory, but instead caused more general spatial memory impairments.",2019-11-01,2020-01-30T07:55:15Z,2020-01-30T11:13:08Z,2020-01-30T07:55:14Z,284-297,NA,NA,120,NA,Cortex,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\X8TQWJKM\Ten Brink et al. - 2019 - Trans-saccadic memory after right parietal brain d.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\WDQSY6MH\S0010945219302370.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Constructional apraxia; Hemispatial neglect; Parietal cortex; Spatial remapping; Spatial working memory,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001624

However, the dynamic time course of infants’ looking behaviors is rarely analyzed. Instead, eye tracking data is often averaged within a large window or is restricted to certain predictive or reactive looks before or after an event, which could conceal interesting looking patterns. In this article, we discuss an alternative approach using spline models – an approachable and informative method for analyzing how the trajectory of infants’ looking behaviors changes at discrete time points. We illustrate the benefits of spline models by demonstrating how to prepare, estimate, and interpret the results of a spline model in R and SAS, and we compare the results with an analysis of averaged looking times within a time window. We show that spline models can reveal patterns in the trajectory of participants’ looking that can be obscured by averaged looking times. Finally, we use a sensitivity analysis to show that spline models are reliable with small samples typical of developmental studies.

We also explored the relationship between linguistic outcomes and other teaching/teacher factors: teaching time, teacher level of French proficiency, and teacher level of training in language instruction. Learners completed a sentence repetition task and a photo description task, making small but statistically significant progress in both grammatical and lexical knowledge between test points.

In Study 1 (N = 179), UAPs, on average, related to greater negative-affect versus positive-affect induction helping tactics. In two experiments, UAPs, on average, related to a greater likelihood of selecting anger-inducing versus love-inducing or sadness-inducing songs to help a target overcome a breakup (Study 2; N = 313) and greater selection of anger-inducing and hubris-inducing messages versus authentic-pride-inducing and love-inducing messages to help a teammate struggling in a game (Study 3; N = 246). UCPs manifested the opposite patterns. Generally, these associations corresponded with helping-strategy utility beliefs and were robust to moderators of helping target (self or other; Study 2) or altruistic versus selfish motives (Study 3). Study 4 (N = 205) provided some evidence of ecological validity in contexts of recalled everyday helping. Associations between personality constructs and relative helping strategies were about moderate in size (rs .20) across these four studies. Findings suggest that UAPs are associated with helping strategies believed to promote ‘contemptuous’ self-enhancement relative to ‘innocuous’ self-enhancement and self-transcendence, and vice versa for UCPs. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:52:22Z,2020-01-30T12:53:53Z,2020-01-30T12:52:22Z,674-701,NA,6,33,NA,NA,Blurring the Dichotomy of Good and Evil,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\VWWCLVAN\Tortoriello and Hart - 2019 - Blurring the Dichotomy of Good and Evil The Idios.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\GE9UR47F\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,OSBadgePreregisteredPlus,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,narcissism; psychopathy; agreeableness; helping; interpersonal affect regulation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,a001628

In the past, neuroscientific research was principally concerned with fluid intelligence, while neglecting its equally important counterpart crystallized intelligence. Crystallized intelligence is defined as the depth and breadth of knowledge and skills that are valued by one's culture. The accumulation of crystallized intelligence is guided by information storage capacities and is likely to be reflected in an individual's level of general knowledge. In spite of the significant role general knowledge plays for everyday life, its neural foundation largely remains unknown. In a large sample of 324 healthy individuals, we used standard magnetic resonance imaging along with functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to examine different estimates of brain volume and brain network connectivity and assessed their predictive power with regard to both general knowledge and fluid intelligence. Our results demonstrate that an individual's level of general knowledge is associated with structural brain network connectivity beyond any confounding effects exerted by age or sex. Moreover, we found fluid intelligence to be best predicted by cortex volume in male subjects and functional network connectivity in female subjects. Combined, these findings potentially indicate different neural architectures for information storage and information processing. © 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology",2019,2020-01-30T12:49:05Z,2020-01-30T12:50:17Z,2020-01-30T12:49:05Z,589-605,NA,5,33,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,© 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology,NA,NA,NA,Wiley Online Library,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HCSGGVUS\Genç et al. - 2019 - The Neural Architecture of General Knowledge.pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\7CBU63AT\per.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,intelligence; brain network connectivity; DTI; general knowledge; interindividual differences,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001630

Except for voting, however, only a nonrepresentative, small group of people regularly engages in political action. Social psychological theories provide individual, group, and system-level explanations for why people could remain inactive. However, they often focus only on personally held attitudes and do not fully consider the dynamics of attitude formation in interactions. Based on 26 focus group discussions conducted in Brazil, Hungary, and the Netherlands, we explored how citizens explain political inaction. We used latent thematic analysis, informed by social psychological theories, to understand how people form opinions about their own and others’ political inaction. In all three countries, the prevalent norm in the focus group discussions was that political inaction should be reduced but a lack of political efficacy constituted a core theme in explaining why people remain politically inactive. Depending on the sociopolitical context and how people self-categorized within the discussions, people blamed unresponsive governments, or cited personal fears of repercussions and cultural differences within and between countries as reasons for inaction. The findings and interpretations are discussed within a framework that extends and integrates previous perspectives on why people remain politically inactive.",2019,2020-01-29T04:16:32Z,2020-01-29T04:16:53Z,2020-01-29T04:16:31Z,381-406,NA,1,19,NA,NA,Social Psychological Explanations of Political Inaction,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,"© 2019 The Authors.

Recent behavioral data suggest that high-priority items in working memory are more vulnerable to disruption. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the hypothesis that prioritization of working memories might impact the recovery of their neural representation(s) after distraction. A delay-period retrospective cue informed participants which of two memory items (a face or a scene) to prioritize during a first delay period. Consistent with prior work, and confirming successful prioritization, multivoxel pattern classifier evidence in perceptual brain regions was higher for cued versus uncued memory items. A distraction task was then imposed before a second retrospective cue informed participants to either “stay” remembering the previously cued item or “switch” to the previously uncued item. This allowed for the evaluation of recovery for high-priority items (on stay trials) and also low-priority items (on switch trials). Classifiers showed successful reinstatement of both high- and low-priority items after distraction, but only low-priority items recovered to their pre-distraction representational levels. Moreover, the degree of prioritization before distraction predicted the amount of disruption for high-priority items after distraction, suggesting that the more a participant prioritized the cued item, the greater the impact of distraction.

Estimating two regression lines, one for low and one for high values of x, allows testing for a sign change without a functional-form assumption.

However, it remains unclear whether such statistical sensitivity is robust across tasks and among subcategories of MWS. In addition, little is known about whether cognitive aptitudes can moderate such sensitivity. This study examined L1 and advanced L2 speakers’ statistical sensitivity to phrasal frequency and contingency as well as cognitive aptitudes’ moderating effects on such sensitivity when processing English adjective-noun collocations. Participants performed a phrasal acceptability judgment task (PJT). Meanwhile, their aptitude profiles were measured by six aptitude tests, which loaded separately onto implicit language aptitude, explicit language aptitude, and working memory capacity. Linear mixed-effects modeling revealed that both L1 and L2 English speakers were sensitive to phrasal frequency and contingency of collocations, although L2 speakers’ sensitivity was much stronger than that of L1 speakers. None of the aptitudes was found to moderate language users’ statistical sensitivity to either collocation frequency or contingency. Interestingly, disassociation patterns between the PJT performance and the involvement of implicit or explicit language aptitude among the L1 and L2 speakers were found. It was concluded that L1 and L2 speakers differed in terms of the way they processed the collocations, as well as the nature of their collocational knowledge.",2018-12,2020-01-28T06:01:38Z,2020-01-28T06:02:49Z,2020-01-28T06:01:38Z,831-856,NA,4,40,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,Cambridge Core,NA,NA,NA,"C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\HSJVH8CJ\Yi - 2018 - STATISTICAL SENSITIVITY, COGNITIVE APTITUDES, AND .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\5EEB75KR\C3CF1F7115E84467677202B8DB30BC8D.html",NA,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001638

We argue that historical explanations generate greater uncertainty about blameworthiness than do biological explanations. They do so because they have both competing and tentative implications regarding agent control. Furthermore, we argue that the blame uncertainty engendered by historical explanations enables motivated cognition in the blame process. We provide evidence for these claims in four studies. In Study 1, we show that computer mouse trajectories are less direct—suggesting uncertainty—when blame assessments are made in cases of historical as compared to biological causation. Studies 2, 3, and 4 test our claims regarding susceptibility to biased cognition. Predisposition to blame was measured in Studies 2 and 3 and manipulated in Study 4. In all studies, predisposition to blame was more potent in shaping blame judgments in cases of historical as compared to biological causation. Evidence suggests that this happened because cases of historical causation are relatively amenable to divergent construals regarding agent control, whereas the implications of biological causation are more definitive. Discussion centers on the importance of motivation—a “merciful mindset”—for effecting blame mitigation in cases where the offender has endured an unfortunate life history.",2018-07-01,2019-03-30T16:25:27Z,2019-03-30T16:25:39Z,2019-03-30T16:25:27Z,11-23,NA,NA,77,NA,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,How much blame does he truly deserve?,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ScienceDirect,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\PRPLBYER\Gill en Ungson - 2018 - How much blame does he truly deserve Historicist .pdf; C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\FSMM5LNF\S0022103117304869.html,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Blame; Blame mitigation; Historical and biological causes; Moral judgment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2018,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001641

However, widespread misunderstanding and misuse of statistical concepts and methods suggests that suboptimal or erroneous statistical practice is routinely overlooked during peer review in psychology. Here, we explore whether psychology journals could ameliorate some of the field’s statistical ailments by adopting specialized statistical review: a focused technical assessment, performed by statistical experts, that addresses the analysis and presentation of quantitative information and supplements regular peer review. We discuss evidence from a recent survey of journal editors suggesting that specialized statistical review may be unusual in psychology journals and is regarded by many editors as unnecessary. We contrast these views with those in the biomedical domain, where statistical review has been considered a partial preventive measure against the improper use of statistics since the late 1970s. We suggest that the current “credibility revolution” presents an opportune occasion for psychology journals to consider adopting specialized statistical review.",2019-09-01,2020-01-14T07:12:08Z,2020-01-14T07:12:22Z,2020-01-14T07:12:07Z,240-249,NA,3,2,NA,Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\6ZT3S2U9\Hardwicke et al. - 2019 - Should Psychology Journals Adopt Specialized Stati.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,OSBadgeOpenMaterials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,peer review; open data; open materials; journal policy; metaresearch; statistical methods; statistical review,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001642

In rodents, the visual thalamus is a major recipient of retinal ganglion cells axons and is divided into three functionally distinct nuclei: the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), ventral LGN (vLGN), and intergeniculate leaflet. Despite being densely innervated by retinal input, each nucleus in rodent visual thalamus possesses diverse molecular profiles which underpin their unique circuitry and cytoarchitecture. Here, we combined large-scale unbiased proteomic and transcriptomic analyses to elucidate the molecular expression profiles of the developing mouse dLGN and vLGN. We identified several extracellular matrix proteins as differentially expressed in these regions, particularly constituent molecules of perineuronal nets (PNNs). Remarkably, we discovered at least two types of molecularly distinct Aggrecan-rich PNN populations in vLGN, exhibiting non-overlapping spatial, temporal, and cell-type specific expression patterns. The mechanisms responsible for the formation of these two populations of PNNs also differ as the formation of Cat315+ PNNs (but not WFA+ PNNs) required input from the retina. This study is first to suggest that cell type- and molecularly specific supramolecular assemblies of extracellular matrix may play important roles in the circuitry associated with the subcortical visual system and in the processing of visual information.

This possibility was tested in a sample of 27 European countries (N = 144?367) and across four experiments (total N = 475). Individual differences in the resistance to social change were related to higher levels of perceived legitimacy no matter the level of inequality of the society. Conversely, individual differences in the acceptance of inequality were related to higher levels of perceived legitimacy in unequal societies, but either a relationship near zero or the opposite relationship was found in more equal societies. These studies highlight the importance of distinguishing between individual differences that make up political ideology, especially when making predictions in diverse settings. ? 2017 The Authors.

However, less is known about the psychological substance of the specific factors of the general psychopathology model or how lower-order facets of neuroticism may relate to each psychopathology factor. We investigated the structure of neuroticism and psychopathology as well as associations between these domains using multimethod assessments in a sample of 695 preadolescent children.

In contrast to previous work which suggests that empathy does not shape the perceptions of injustice, the present research proposes that while perceptions of fairness in the context of injustice are dynamic, they may well be shaped by empathy. Using a dictator-style paradigm, the present research explored the extent to which empathy is related to perceptions of injustice and in turn, compensating forms of inequality. A non-registered Study 1 (N = 466) found that higher empathy predisposition is related to perceiving more injustice in contexts of inequality. Preregistered Study 2 (N = 406) extended this finding by experimentally manipulating empathy, showing that emphasising with the victim of inequality is indirectly related to perceiving injustice. The hypothesised mechanism, empathy allowing identification and experiencing the feelings of anger associated with the injustice, is supported in Study 2. As such, perceptions of fairness are not static; empathy is argued to be an important mechanism in forming justice perceptions.

At baseline, patients completed the Suicide–Implicit Association Test (S–IAT), a semistructured interview, and a self-report measure of suicide ideation. Six months later, we contacted participants by phone and examined their hospital medical records to determine whether they had made a new suicide attempt. Results showed that the S–IAT did not distinguish between patients who were admitted to the hospital following suicide attempts and those who were admitted for other reasons.

This is puzzling, as stress and anxiety typically have deleterious effects on cognitive control and performance. The traditional explanation is that stress reduces “cue utilisation”: It withdraws attentional resources from less relevant stimuli (including the distracter word), meaning that the target colour is left with a stronger influence over response selection. However, it could also be that stress somehow boosts distracter inhibition, or some other aspect of executive control. To test these two accounts, 59 students completed a Stroop task featuring occasional startlingly loud sounds (high stress) or the same sounds at a lower, comfortable volume (low stress). Alongside standard Stroop interference, two measures of executive control—negative priming and conflict adaptation—were calculated from the Stroop data. Stress produced a clear reduction of Stroop interference, but it did not influence negative priming, and no conflict adaptation effects were detected at all. These findings support the cue utilisation account. Furthermore, for the first time, stress was shown to reduce Stroop interference in a task with no congruent trials, showing that the effect does not result from stress’s modulating any strategy changes participants might make in response to congruent trials.",2019-06-01,2020-02-05T06:05:25Z,2020-02-05T06:05:36Z,2020-02-05T06:05:25Z,1522-1529,NA,6,72,NA,Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology,Reduced Stroop interference under stress,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,en,NA,NA,NA,NA,SAGE Journals,NA,NA,NA,C:\Users\Steve\Zotero\storage\2H3KB9U3\Booth - 2019 - Reduced Stroop interference under stress Decrease.pdf,NA,OSBadgeOpenData,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,stress; cue utilisation; executive control; Stroop interference,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2019,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,a001658

It is however poorly understood how perceptual decisions unfold in time when people discriminate the expression of emotions transmitted using dynamic facial and vocal signals, as in natural social context. In this study, we relied on a gating paradigm to track how the recognition of emotion expressions across the senses unfold over exposure time. We first demonstrate that across all emotions tested, a discriminatory decision is reached earlier with faces than with voices. Importantly, multisensory stimulation consistently reduced the required accumulation of perceptual evidences needed to reach correct discrimination (Isolation Point). We also observed that expressions with different emotional content provide cumulative evidence at different speeds, with “fear” being the expression with the fastest isolation point across the senses. Finally, the lack of correlation between the confusion patterns in response to facial and vocal signals across time suggest distinct relations between the discriminative features extracted from the two signals.

We examine lay perceptions of virtue, and show that different psychological drivers of virtuous behavior are relevant for different types of actions. When evaluating non-moral virtuous behavior, such as choosing to skip dessert, attributions of virtue depend on perceived willpower (i.e., the extent to which someone overcomes temptation in service of acting virtuous). In contrast, when evaluating moral virtuous behavior, such as choosing to be faithful to a spouse, attributions of virtue depend on perceived purity (i.e., the extent to which someone lacks temptation to sin and thereby does not need to exert willpower in service of acting virtuously). Study 1 demonstrates that when people describe their own actions, they associate willpower with non-moral virtuous behavior, and purity with moral virtuous behavior. Studies 2 & 3 examine judgments of others and show that as behaviors become moralized, people elevate the importance of purity relative to willpower when ascribing virtue. Finally, Study 4 examines perceptions of those who are “reformed”—having eliminated their previous sinful desires such that they no longer feel tempted. For non-moral behaviors, reformed individuals are seen as strong-willed and thus highly virtuous. However, for moral behaviors, reformed individuals are still seen as somewhat impure, and are judged to be less virtuous than those have never felt tempted by a particular vice.
